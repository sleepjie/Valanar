**The Celestial Calendar**
The Illuminators of Draconia dubbed the Day of Sacrifice to be the start of a new age; an age without the Primordials. By a twist of fate, there are six months to a calendar year, and so the Illuminators chose to name their celestial calendar in honour of the Primordials. Celestial events are recorded in six year intervals, so it is a useful metric, and also an important reminder to remember the titles of the ones who stood watch over all life on the material plane; they ensured its continued survival for at least as long as the Elder Gods deigned.

## Story of Creation
In the yawning void, two swirling masses appeared. Where there was nothing, conscience emerged. These twin consciences were the Elder Gods, and with their birth, the void began to churn.    

In the Primordial Void, an unknowable vacuum of infinite possibility, twin flames began to flicker to life; The Elder Gods. They shared a dual consciousness, and for an unknowable length of time, the Elder Gods harnessed sentience from the cosmos, causing their powers as well as their understanding of them to grow exponentially. In an act of curiosity, they successfully attempted to weave the psionic energy they had been granted into Manamaterium; suddenly, where there was once nothing, there was magic, the antithesis of the void, and with magic came a great roar; the advent of the prime material planes; one for each of them.

**I. The Genesis of Manamaterium**
In the beginning, there was only the Primordial Void, an endless vacuum of infinite possibility, where time and space held no meaning. Within this emptiness, two flames flickered to life—the Elder Gods. These twin beings, born of the void itself, shared a dual consciousness, their sentience drawn from the boundless potential of the cosmos. For untold eons, they existed in contemplation, their powers and knowledge growing as they explored the limitless scope of their existence.

As the Elder Gods' understanding deepened, so did their curiosity. It was this curiosity that led them to their first great experiment—the attempt to weave psionic energy into something tangible. In this act, they gave birth to the essence of Manamaterium, the raw fabric of magic and material reality. Where there had once been nothing, there was now something—a great roar echoed across the void as the Material Plane sprang into existence. This was the first creation, the beginning of all substance and form.

The Material Plane, however, was initially a grey and lifeless place—a vast expanse of static, unmoving land, devoid of meaning or purpose. The Elder Gods, unsatisfied with this empty world, sought to introduce the elements of change and movement. They conjured the four primary elements—earth, air, fire, and water—and created planes in which these elements could thrive, separate yet interconnected with the Material Plane. Each element became a primordial force, its nature wild and untamed, setting the stage for the further evolution of the cosmos.

Yet, these elements needed pathways to flow between their planes and the Material Plane, and so the Elder Gods devised the Chaos Channels. These channels served as conduits through which the primal forces of earth, air, fire, and water could intermingle in the Material Realm. Through their interplay, the natural world began to form. Mountains rose from the earth, oceans spread across the land, and the winds of air swept across the seas, while fire provided warmth and energy. This was the birth of natural order, the first step in the transformation of the Material Plane from a barren place to one filled with the potential for life.

The Elder Gods marvelled at their creation, but they knew it was not yet complete. The elements alone could not sustain the complexity of life they envisioned. There needed to be a force that balanced the creation of form and matter with the metaphysical—a force that could support the essence of thought, consciousness, and the abstract. To achieve this, the Elder Gods conceived the planes of Positive and Negative Energy. These two forces were the opposite poles of existence—one giving life and creation, the other governing death, decay, and entropy. Together, they brought balance to the Material Plane on a metaphysical level, ensuring that life could thrive and that all things would eventually return to the void from which they came.

**II. The Ordering of the Planes**
The Twin Gods knew that in order for these beings to more closely resemble the consciousness they shared, they would need a deeper understanding of what it was to exist. 

Twin voids were torn from the fabric of space: the Positive and Negative Polaris, black holes which allowed the energies of the void to coalesce with the realms of manamaterium, creating a chain reaction of primordial destruction and creation, all at the same time, balanced in perfect, perpetual synchronicity. The creation of the Positive and Negative Polaris set the foundation for what would become the Astral Ocean, a metaphysical realm where the concepts of thought, ego, and consciousness would take form, as well as engendering the cycle of time itself.

In the Astral Ocean, stars were not merely physical objects but represented ideas, and the vast constellations mapped the thoughts and desires of the cosmos. This realm would serve as a bridge between the Material Plane and the metaphysical, allowing for the possibility of lifeforms with free will and awareness. These were passages - gateways between the realm of thought and the realm of corporeality, allowing the two essences to converse with one another, cohabiting and amalgamating into what we understand as true sentience, and as the polaris rotate, time advances forwards. 

Next, the Elder Gods deigned to reproduce that which kept themselves astute, their constant battle between order and chaos. They looked introspectively, deciding to truncate a single part of each of themselves to engender the planes of Praesidium and Kaas. Praesidium was sculpted to be pristine - chalky marble architecture whose fingers dip beyond the clouds, and impossible structures made of shimmering glass - a domain crafted with precision beyond mortal capabilities. Kaas was an affront to logic, an inhospitable place where time and place have no meaning; an overflowing cauldron containing all of the ingredients for life, but with no direction. The battle waged between these planes in the mind of all living things would be one of the very few constants in the Material Plane: the intrinsic need for design and order, and the base instinct to tear it all down.

**III. The Titans & The Pillars of Creation**
The canvas was set, and with the material plane primed for beings to inhabit it, the Elder Gods naturally began experimenting with consciousness; their first creations were rudimentary beings, bereft of free will and severely lacking in depth or congruent thought. These dull, grotesque entities were hollow mirrors of the basest understanding of life, a crude forgery of mechanical predator instinct and flesh. 

Their failure only led to further refinement; with each successive creation, the Elder Gods' craftsmanship improved, and they grew more adept at blending Manamaterium with Metamaterium, infusing their creations with the ability to think, choose, and grow. Their final triumph was the creation of the Titans, nine great beings of immense power who could exist simultaneously in both the Material Plane and the metaphysical realms.

The Elder Gods, having departed to continue their cosmic experiments, left the Titans in charge of the Material Plane. These nine towering figures, imbued with fragments of the Elder Gods' own power, carried the Pillars of Creation, mighty artefacts that granted them control over reality itself. Each Titan was attuned to a different aspect of the Material and Metaphysical realms, allowing them to mould the world according to the whims of their divine intellect. For centuries, the Titans shaped the planes, refining the forces of nature, expanding the realms of Manamaterium, and establishing balance across the universe.

As the aeons passed, however, the perfection the Elder Gods sought began to unravel. The Titans, ever-experimenting with life and existence, began to question their limitations. Their creations became more complex, more attuned to the material and metaphysical essences, but their frustrations grew. Despite their immense power, the Titans were still bound by the laws of creation established by the Elder Gods.

Amid these growing doubts, a forgotten consequence of the Elder Gods' past experiments stirred in the Primordial Void. The Archfiends—beings cast away as failed creations—had not perished. Instead, they had festered, feeding on the psionic energy that had originally been their undoing. These twisted entities, bathed in eternal anguish, had become something new: powerful, vindictive, and driven by hatred for the world that had rejected them.

In the early days of the Material Plane, the Titans ruled as divine stewards of creation. Among them, Upir, the Titan of Fate and Knowledge, had long held secret knowledge of their mortality. Upir foresaw the end of the Titans’ reign and orchestrated a grand plan that would bring forth a new order: the Higher Pantheon. But for this to happen, an event of monumental importance—a catalyst—was necessary: the first murder in history.

Malkis, the Titan of Death, was a being of great ambition, often described as the Master of Chaos. He was proud, powerful, and loved by Paletress, the Titaness of Life and Creation. Paletress represented everything Malkis did not: she was nurturing, wise, and calm, wielding the Verdant Oath, a rod that could grant life and ensure the health of all living things.

The Archfiends, twisted beings born from the Elder Gods' early failed creations, saw in Malkis an opportunity to exact their revenge on the Titans. Through insidious whispers, they preyed on Malkis’ emotions, feeding him lies and deceit. The Archfiends convinced Malkis that Upir was withholding knowledge that could save them, and worse, that Upir had seen something horrible in Malkis' future but refused to act. Specifically, the Archfiends suggested that Upir knew of Paletress' eventual death but did nothing to prevent it.

Consumed by grief and paranoia, Malkis sought answers from Upir. On the Night of Grand Deception, he confronted Upir, accusing him of treachery and betrayal. Upir, knowing that this confrontation was necessary to his plan, responded cryptically, refusing to give Malkis the answers he sought. In a blind rage, Malkis struck Upir down, committing the first murder in history.

This act shattered the Titans’ belief in their immortality. Upir’s death revealed the truth: the Titans, like all things bound to Manamaterium, were mortal. Malkis, horrified by what he had done, fled to Paletress, seeking her comfort in the wake of his crime. In his desperation and grief, Malkis sought not only comfort but solace in Paletress’ presence. Overcome by his emotions, Malkis forced himself upon her, and from this violation, the first of the gods was conceived: Kane.

Kane, born shortly after this terrible act, embodied the dual nature of his father’s malice and his mother’s purity. He was a being caught between life and death, representing both humanity and destruction. Kane’s birth was a harbinger of the end of the Titans' reign. He was not a force of balance like his siblings but a god of malice and anger, forever cursed by the circumstances of his conception.

Following this event, Magnus was born—Kane’s younger half-brother. Unlike Kane, Magnus inherited his mother’s wisdom and compassion. He was beloved by all the Titans, embodying the hope and order that the new gods would need to guide the world. The other Titans believed that Kane and Magnus were twins, unaware of the dark truth behind Kane’s conception.

While the Titans mourned Upir’s death, Upir himself had ascended to the Astral Ocean, as he had planned all along. From his new vantage, Upir revealed the truth of Kane’s birth to Kane himself: Malkis had not conceived him out of love but in an act of violence. Paletress had not chosen Malkis at that moment; she had been violated, and Kane’s very existence was a product of rage and despair. This revelation shattered Kane’s fragile sense of identity, filling him with an anger that would eventually consume him. Upir’s plan had been set in motion. He had orchestrated his own death so that the Titans’ reign would give way to the Higher Pantheon, and it was Kane’s rage that would bring about the fall of the Titans.

**IV. The Shattering & The Great Exodus**
Kane, filled with anger and sorrow at the truth of his birth, confronted Malkis, accusing him of the rape of Paletress and of lying about the nature of their existence. Malkis, already burdened by the guilt of Upir’s murder, could not deny the accusations. Kane, in a fit of fury, struck down his father, killing Malkis with the use of his own fabled Pillar; the Horn of Malkis.

This act—the Shattering—marked the beginning of the end for the Titans. With Malkis’ death, the Titans’ authority was irrevocably broken. The remaining Titans, devastated by the loss of their kin and the knowledge of their own mortality, retreated into the Outer Planes, leaving the Material Plane to the Higher Pantheon. 

Thus, Magnus, filled with sorrow but determined to forge a new path, declared the beginning of the Great Exodus. Alongside him were the other gods of the High Pantheon, including Seradriel, the God of the Elves, and his Serende’hel followers. Kane, consumed by his rage and guilt, ruled in isolation, his malice darkening the skies of his homeland. No god could remain there without being consumed by the tragedy that had unfolded. It was Magnus, the god of Order and Justice, who declared it was time to leave. A new world lay across the great seas—a land untouched by the crimes of the Titans, a blank slate where the gods could begin anew: Valanar.

Magnus led the gods across the waters in what would be known as ‘The Great Exodus’ by future generations, and with him came their followers—mortals who had devoted themselves to the Higher Pantheon. They followed their gods, leaving behind the ashes of their old lives to seek a new destiny in a land they had only heard whispers of in ancient myths. The journey across the great ocean was long and perilous, but for these mortals, it was not just a physical journey—it was the start of a new age.

**V. The Primordial Sacrifice**
The Primordial Dragons were created by the Gods upon their arrival in Valanar, their purpose clear: to serve as the protectors of the Material Plane, maintaining the boundaries between the planes and ensuring that the forces of chaos—especially those from the Abyssal Planes—could not breach the sanctity of creation. These dragons, imbued with immense power, became the eternal guardians of Valanar, existing beyond the passage of time itself. They were timeless, ageless, and unrelenting in their mission to preserve balance across the cosmos.

But as the ages passed, the Primordials came to realise the limitations of their immortality. Though powerful, they understood that no force, not even they, could hold back the chaos of the Abyss forever. Time, while not affecting their physical form, was eroding their strength, and the threats they faced from the Outer Planes were only growing more numerous and relentless. Eventually, they would falter. And should they fail, the world would be swallowed by chaos.

It was in this moment of foresight that the Primordial Dragons came together and made a decision that would forever shape the fate of Valanar: they would exchange their immortality for the ability to procreate. The logic was simple, yet profound: their children, unlike themselves, would be able to grow, to adapt, and to multiply. Each generation would be stronger than the last, evolving to meet the rising challenges of the universe.

They petitioned Bælthatrax, the overseer of their kind and a wise and revered force among the dragons. Understanding the gravity of their request, Bælthatrax granted them this sacrifice, allowing the Primordials to become the first mortal dragons. In doing so, the Primordials set the stage for the birth of dragonkind—a lineage that would extend far beyond their own time, ensuring that Valanar would be defended for millennia to come.

As the centuries wore on, a day came when the sky itself was torn open. A rift, blacker than the darkest night, appeared above Valanar, and from it poured forth the twisted, unspeakable creatures of the Abyssal Planes—chaos given form, seeking to consume the world. The very fabric of reality seemed on the verge of collapse, as these creatures spilled into the Material Plane, threatening to undo all that the Gods and the Primordials had worked so hard to protect.

The Primordial Dragons, despite their newfound mortality, rose to meet this final challenge. Knowing that even they could not fight this endless tide of Abyssal horrors, they made the ultimate sacrifice. Together, they flew into the rift, plunging into the heart of the Abyss, carrying with them the power to seal the breach. As they entered the void, the rift closed behind them, forever cutting them off from the Material Plane.

This act of selflessness became known as the Sacrifice of the Immortals. It was the final chapter in the story of the Primordial Dragons, as they gave their lives to ensure that the boundaries between the planes would hold, preventing the chaos of the Abyss from overtaking the world they had sworn to protect. Though the rift was sealed, the cost was devastating: the Primordial Dragons were never seen again, their fates intertwined with the endless darkness of the Abyss.

Some scholars and priests believe that the Primordials perished in the act of sealing the rift, their powers consumed by the very forces they sought to contain. Others hold to the hope that the Primordials still live, slumbering in hidden depths or existing in some far corner of the cosmos, their minds filled with ancient knowledge and secrets far beyond the understanding of mortals.

	Skaldava attempts to break away from the Empire in a short uprising known as the White Wall Rebellion.  
- **514SR/524SR** - *The Nydessan Purge*
	Relations were always strained between the native Orcs of Nydessa and the force of Men who took the land as their own - it was an unspoken rule that going into the Thornwood Forest would result in death by the Orcs, but attacks on roads and even sometimes to towns were common problems. This all boiled over when a regiment of soldiers led by King Uriel's brother in law, Lord Thackton Virt, was sacked and mutilated a few miles east of Stonereach. This caused the king to go into a great rage, ordering the eradication of the native Orcs from Nydessa. The bloody war lasted ten years, with heavy casualties being suffered on both sides; although the Humans had equipment and manpower, they were still in unnatural territory - most wars were fought in fields, and the forests were a completely different situation, with the Orcs using this to their advantage their lack of manpower did not hinder them. After these years though Human scouting parties began to find less and less camps, seeing that the Orcs had either fled or been wiped out, the war was called to an end. Although the humans see this as a victory on their side, there still live remnants of the native Orcs in Thornwood.
**924SR** - *The Great God War*
	Also referred to as The Ancient Dragon War, which was the first worldwide conflict between the Demigods of the Lower Pantheon and the Lower Fiends of Valanar. Due to the overpopulation of beings with powers which rivalled them, many had disputes with each other over who governed what. Over time, the Archfiends built up groups led by Lower Fiends, and erupted into war when one of these groups began launching attacks onto the Material Plane of Valanar. The ascended beings attacked their rivals, using Valanar as a staging ground. The residents of The Ancient Isles were dragged into holy conquests which they had no hopes of winning. Some of the Demigods collaborated to a point where they altered the beings of the Draconic creatures in The Ancient Isles, and created the powerful and destructive dragons that were the norm from then onwards. In the end the Ancient Isles were ravished with no clear victors. Many beings fled, including those of great renown, leaving behind nothing but destruction, and terribly weakened communities. The Gods, seeing the effects of the allure of power on their subjects, chose then to take a step back, vowing to never interfere as recklessly as they had, choosing instead to live in forbearance.
	Those left behind were left to herald their own fates - creating a new age of Man. In the aftermath of Valanar’s first great war nothing was left unchanged; Einartoft’s southern ocean was frozen over, magical beings rose to power in their respective realms, and many powerful entities were banished amongst the planes.

### The Age of Man
In the aftermath of the Great God War

- **925SR** - 
	The Age of Man begins. The remaining Gods begin to help humanity rebuild itself, this time with a less heavy handed approach - beings are left to try and find their ways on their own, with the subtle guidance of the Gods. Men experiment and build, creating a society and world for themselves. In this age a man truly does forge his own fate. 
- **942SR** - 
	King of Einartoft is assassinated, his only son, Eryk, immediately assumes the throne at the age of sixteen.
- **950SR** - Einartoft Invades Draymond
	Einartoft sparks a war with Draymond after years of building tensions over trade and tax.

### The Age of War

- **2283SR/2284AV** - *Birth of Verassi*
	A powerful Lich known as Dalamar takes control of eight extremely powerful Dragons, using them to wipe out the Holy City of Nassau. The Draymond Empire surrenders shortly after, and Dalamar is free to summon the God-Queen, Verassi.
- **2363AV** - *The Battle of Snowden* 
	Snowden is besieged by Verassi's forces and are eventually repelled. 
- **2365AV** - Assault on Sadurak
- **2366AV** - 
	The Order of the Hammer, led by a man known as “The Abbot”, quickly takes control over what remains of Draymond’s military forces and makes concerted efforts towards rebuilding civilization. This enables them to enforce their dogmatic creed onto the public, outlawing magics and religion, amongst other things. 
- **2399AV** - The Age of Strife Begins
	The dissolution of Verassi’s empire leads to a time of great change and turmoil, including mass famines and genocides across the world. This is known as the era of darkness, as the days progressively grew shorter and the sun grew dimmer, until all that was left… was strife.

### The Age of Strife
- **2400AV** - 
	From the ashes of the old world, and the shadows of the last great war, the last of Man remains huddled in overcrowded cities, fighting against the encroaching tides of decay. 
	
	The world was shattered by magic; plains became deserts, mountains crumbled, storms raged. Where once was law, order and empire, now only hardship and savagery remain. In a time where a man's worth is measured by his word, might makes right, and a quick death is a mercy, only those who are foolish or brave venture far from home.
- **2414AV** - 
	Earthquakes cause irrevocable change as the mountain valleys of Einartoft shift and crack, destroying towns and cities all across the Snow Kingdom. Communities are either divided or wiped out; in many cases citizens flee to Snowden where conditions were not much better. King Willhelm V declares martial law and closes the gates to the city.   
- **2415AV** -
	Serpent’s Pass is felled, as the Dwarves seal Khard off from the rest of the world. 
	
	The Capital City of the Elven Isle collapses into the ocean, after years of inclement weather decimating the landscape. Once again left without a home, the Elves scatter to the far corners of the world.
	
	Witches and heretics are burned in the streets.

### The Age of Ash
- **???AV** -
	When the Elder Gods, the mightiest of all beings, created the Titans and had their first attempt at granting life, they watched and observed. As their children worked to paint the details on the grand canvas their creators had given them, they noticed a fatal flaw in their design; for the Titans were immortal, and their world was too grand, their picture too perfect. The Elder Gods created the concept of chaos to balance order, night to balance the day, winter to balance the summer, and death to balance life. All things were made of magic; the sun, the Gods which would become the stars, the flowers, the creatures, but even the most powerful of magic is finite, and thus the Elder God’s creation was finally put in perfect balance, for in time, all magic would begin to fade.
	
	The Gods, creatures of incredible magic, protectors to all of the life the Titans had crafted and guardians of mankind, disappeared from the world. Their planes, which themselves were magical representations of the roles they played in this dance of order and chaos, fade into the void from whence the Elder Gods came. The stars no longer shine in the night sky, and almost as a cruel metaphor, the days are dim and the nights pitch black.
	
	Other creatures of intense power are weakened as the magic which once upheld all life begins to vanish, and many die out. As the non-material planes begin to shrink in size until eventually ceasing to exist, so too does the strength of their boundaries to the other planes of Valanar, and many demons desperately flee to the prime material plane where they might cling to their meagre power before they too fade away.  
	
	Beings in the spectral realms, who avoided returning to the Well of Souls through devotion to their deity or by circumstance alone, return to the void, as the Well ceases to churn. 
	
	The magical essence in all life begins to fade; crops cease to grow, roving bands of warriors stalk the lands in search of prey, and the world, just as all that came before it, slowly dies.
	
	One day, the Elder Gods may return, and in their infinite wisdom, see it fit to continue their experiment. A plant will grow, a baby will be born, a lone star will appear in the night sky. 
	
	Or, perhaps not. Who could possibly know?

# Geography
Valanar is home to six continents and dozens of small island nations. 

---
## Dol-Calandria
The largest and most temperate continent in Valanar, home to the ‘Black Empire’ of Draymond and previously the seat of the old Doyverd Kingdom, which the vast majority of human civilisations can trace their roots back to.
### Draymond
##### Population and Demographics 
Draymond is the largest and most diverse cultural centre on Dol’Calandria, often referred to as the "melting pot" of Valanar. The population is primarily Human, with a significant number of Elves who migrated during various historical periods, particularly after the Serende'hel Reformation. The union of these two races gave rise to a notable population of Half-Elves, many of whom occupy significant roles in the empire’s political, academic, and military spheres. Other races, such as the Dwarrow and the Glimmerhin, are also present, though fewer in number; living primarily in merchant enclaves and guild strongholds, particularly in industrial zones and mining regions near the western border. While not a dominant political force, they are economically critical to Draymond’s infrastructure, supplying everything from arms to engineering expertise.

In the south and along the eastern marches, there are sizeable populations of Half-Orcs and Orkryn, many of whom are the descendants of imperial auxiliaries or labourers brought over from Nydessa. 

The ecology of Draymond is likewise diverse. 
##### History and Founding
###### Kingdom of Doyverd
Founded by Human settlers before recorded time, Draymond’s origins as a kingdom go as far back as the first men; although records are limited, evidence within the Illuminator Archives suggests a primitive nation known as Doyverd was the first civilisation to call the southern reaches of the continent home from as early as 2000BR, spreading out from what is now the country of Draymond into the rest of Dol-Calandria.

It was not until Francis the Black ascended to the throne in 1888BR that Doyverd began expanding to what it would eventually become. By 1800BR, the Kingdom of Doyverd was a vast empire of fiefdoms and city-states that sought to dominate the northern reaches of Dol’Calandria, coming into conflict with Old Vitgaard, a fiercely independent kingdom that refused to submit to imperial rule. The conflict between Doyverd and Vitgaard would cumulatively last for almost a thousand years, culminating in what scholars now call the War of the Long Winter.

Francis, an exceptionally long lived Morrowsean who we now believe to have been cursed with vampirism some time before the Great Exodus, remained the Emperor for the majority of this period until his mysterious disappearance in the year 1000BR, seemingly vanishing with the turn of the millennium. For some years prior he had been known to have been delegating tasks and ruling from the privacy of his quarters. Having never birthed an heir - likely due to his condition - the sudden disappearance and abdication of Francis the Black remains one of history's most prevalent anomalies. 

Doyverd collapsed sometime around 850BR following almost a milennia of war with Old Vitgaard, who managed to not only successfully repel dozens of invasion attempts but also splinter Doyverd’s hold over their own fiefdoms politically, as many of the Black Empire's constituents had steadily declined into factionalism following many decades of sacrifice and the failings of bureaucracy, as well as of course the steady emergence of differing cultures over time. 
###### The Rise of Draymond
Draymond, the central constituency and throne of both the first and second Black Empire(s), remained uniquely politically steadfast during its initial dissolution. 

Despite the collapse of the central authority within Draymond (or perhaps because of it), the country prospered under a deliberate shift in focus toward domestic development, which they achieved in a few key ways: by allowing local rulers to govern their own regions with relative autonomy, Draymond’s central leadership was able to placate rival factions that might have otherwise been inclined to rebel. The system of regional rule kept power decentralised enough to avoid revolt, while still ensuring that the overarching authority of the throne remained intact. In addition to military diplomacy, Draymond struck trade deals with nearby kingdoms and fiefdoms, ensuring the flow of resources into its cities and reinforcing its status as a prosperous and influential nation. This economic interdependence helped prevent hostile actions from neighbours, as they relied on Draymond for vital goods and infrastructure.

###### Annexation of Skaldava
Around 1600BR, the leaders of Skaldava, a harsh and impoverished region east of Draymond, found themselves in desperate need of resources. Isolated and economically deprived, they saw an opportunity in attacking one of Draymond's smaller border cities. Believing that Draymond, in its period of internal consolidation, would be too distracted or weakened to retaliate, they launched a months-long siege on the city, hoping to capture its resources and gain a foothold in the more prosperous western regions.

However, Skaldava underestimated both the cunning and resilience of Draymond’s leadership; instead of sending troops to break the siege, Draymond's Black Lords chose a more ruthless and strategic response—economic isolation. Much of Skaldava’s survival depended on caravans and merchants passing through its lands to deliver essential goods and supplies, and with this in mind, Draymond issued a trade embargo on Skaldava, preventing any goods from reaching the region. The flow of food, weapons, and other supplies that Skaldava relied upon ceased entirely, leaving the nation to wither under its own isolation. 

Draymond further escalated its response by capturing Skaldavan civilians who were found travelling in or near Draymond to be used as leverage, not only demoralising the Skaldavan leadership but also stoking fear within their population. As the siege dragged on and resources dwindled, Skaldava quickly crumbled under the economic pressure. The people of Skaldava began to starve, and the siege, once thought to be a bold power grab, became an untenable disaster; seeing no other way to survive, the Lords of Skaldava reluctantly capitulated to Draymond’s demands, and the nation as a whole was submitted into becoming Draymond’s first vassal state since the collapse of the Doyverd Empire, marking the beginning of a new era in Draymond’s expansionist strategy. 
###### Annexation of Florence
Skaldava's submission sent a clear message to other neighbouring regions: resist Draymond at your peril. Shortly following, 
###### The Serende'hel Reformation
The Serende'hel Reformation represents a pivotal epoch in the annals of both the Ende'hel and the Draymond Empire. This period, spanning several decades, marked not only a profound cultural and societal integration but also ushered in a renaissance of learning and development that reshaped the broader landscape of the region. The Reformation was precipitated by a series of calamitous events that rendered the Ende'hel homeland uninhabitable; the relentless wars with the Orcs and Giants, coupled with internal strife between the Ende'hel and the Enadriel, led to the downfall of their once-great civilization. The final blow came with the invasion and subsequent occupation of their lands by a coalition of Orc and Giant forces, which forced the Ende'hel to seek refuge elsewhere.

Upon their arrival, the Ende'hel were met with suspicion and guarded curiosity by the Draymond populace. However, their need for asylum and the strategic advantages of their knowledge and abilities gradually led to a tentative integration. Emperor Ludvik the Black, upon recognizing the potential benefits of embracing these new arrivals, offered them an accord; sanctuary in exchange for their expertise in all things from military strategy to science, magic and history, thereby sowing the seeds of the Reformation and forever changing the world of Men. Three years following their arrival, the Serende’hel Reformation was officially decreed and the Draymond calendar was instituted as the most modern and accurate model of history, henceforth beginning the year 0SR.

The most enduring impacts of the Serende'hel Reformation were perhaps seen in the fields of education and cultural exchange. The Ende'hel established centres of learning that soon became the nucleus of new thought, blending Draymond and Ende'hel traditions. These centres not only taught magical arts but also introduced advanced concepts of science and mathematics previously unknown to Draymond scholars; the Ende'hel likewise had a profound impact on literacy, primarily through the introduction of their script, which was adapted to form a unified writing system used throughout the empire. They established the first libraries and laid the foundations for public education systems that emphasised critical reading and interpretation of texts.

Politically, the Ende'hel brought new concepts of governance, which included the establishment of a more structured bureaucratic system and the introduction of equitable laws that emphasised justice and fairness, rather than the traditional feudalistic approach that had predominated. Socially, the Ende'hel's influence led to more inclusive attitudes, slowly eroding the stark barriers between the various classes within the Empire. 
###### Post Reformation
Following the Reformation, Draymond’s hold over the continent only solidified further. 

It was only due to the Northern Concordat that their influence did not spread further past Caldwynn, which was annexed by Draymond 
##### Economy and Currency
The legal tender for all countries of the Black Empire is ducats, denominated by weight. The Imperial Bank was established as both the national treasury and the national bank of Draymond in 23SR and established not only a standardised currency system but a centralised banking system which enabled the private sectors to flourish. 

Though the majority of cities within Draymond are considered affluent, the northern cities embody the Empire’s grandiosity in totality. Conversely, the southern half of Draymond is responsible for the vast majority of the country’s domestic mining and agricultural sectors, and though t

Magic shops are abundant in Draymond, as merchants from all over the world travel to the Capital of the Empire, Sadurak City, which is located on the north-western coast. 
##### Culture and Society 
The first banner of the Black Empire notably depicted a soaring griffon, meant to represent their place in the world as noble and sophisticated predators. Kings of the Doyverd Lineage were known to ride Griffons into battle, and they are considered a protected species even in modern Draymond. 

Draymond was the first country to integrate the Ende’hel by assimilating many parts of their culture. The Ende’hel significantly impacted many areas of society after the Reformation, and though some were slow to adapt to the changes and the Ende’hel faced initial xenophobia, the sociopolitical landscape of the Empire drastically shifted as a whole following that point. 

The Elves also brought knowledge of exotic plants and agricultural techniques that allowed for year-round cultivation, diversifying the diet of Draymond's populace and leading to a surge in population growth and urban development.

Citizens of the Empire are often both patriotic and well versed in the Empire’s history as the story of the Serende’hel is commonly taught. Children of common birth are entitled to basic education from the ages of 3-9, learning the fundamentals of arithmetic and literacy, as well as having access to vocational apprenticeships such as blacksmithing and carpentry. Higher education is also available to those who can afford it, as well as various institutions dedicated to more specific pursuits such as theatre or animal husbandry. 

Prior to the Serende’hel Reformation, bathhouses existed mostly as private institutions owned by women of the peasant class, with more lavish establishments existing only for royalty or nobility. However, among the technologies granted to Draymond as part of their mutual alliance with the Serende’hel was the introduction of a primitive form of indoor plumbing, as well as many advancements in architecture, physics and mathematics. Cities were no longer constructed of wood and stone, but brick, mortar and iron, and this meant that public bathhouses could be constructed by anyone with the means and resources. 

Access to these bathhouses is, on average, very affordable. Some bathhouses are more lavish or pampered than others, but most will get the job done and are maintained and cleaned by law. Private bath houses operated by criminal syndicates sometimes offer ‘alternative’ services, though the legality of these services can only be described as questionable at best. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
A mostly temperate climate, Draymond is flanked by two mountain ranges with verdant forests toward the northern border of Florence and sparse stretches of hills and plains in the south. Most of the cities and larger settlements are located in the warmer and more fertile northern regions, though there are many older settlements in the south which have been built upon over the centuries. 
##### Settlements & Structures


Illuminator HQ
Secretive meetings are often held here as ambassadors from every walk of life are treated with neutrality. Within the walls of the Illuminator’s vast fortress of knowledge and magic, one can find themselves lost amidst a sea of ancient texts, artefacts, and long kept secrets. It is here that the Grand Illuminators are honoured with statues depicting their visage, lining the courtyards of the meticulously kept gardens at the front of the castle, where all different kinds of plants, flowers and herbs are cultivated.

Sadurak City
Once separated into two settlements on both sides of the River Brynth. It is the largest city in the world with an approximate population of 200,000, growing to 300,000 by the Age of Man. 
##### Military and Naval Power 
Given Draymond’s considerable size and wealth, it is no wonder that its military has long been considered one of the most powerful mobile forces in the world. The Empire’s Military follows a much more stringent doctrine of routine discipline and individual excellence, which like many things, they inherited from the Serende’hel and their military structure. 

Even before the Black Empire was established, 

The Empire’s military ranking system, while bureaucratic and hierarchical, has a very distinctive chain of command. 

Though not the first to utilise magic for naval purposes, Draymond’s Navy were perhaps the first to utilise and even emphasise Warmages aboard their fleets.

### Nassau
##### Population and Demographics 
Nassau is principally populated by Humans and Ende'hel. 
##### History and Founding
Prior to its founding, Nassau was principally inhabited by 

Nassau was founded around 1000BR by Francis the Black, it is widely considered to be the birthplace of modern theology and its construction was ordered as a place for the papacy and the clergy of every known deity to congregate and study Pantheonism; the polytheistic belief that all Gods exist in tandem and perfect with harmony with one another as arbiters of balancing the universe. Francis himself was possessed of an enlightened perspective on the Gods and helped to shape early religious views, even before the Serende'hel Reformation. Much of the debate that happened during these early days were inconclusive and were fuelled with speculations about the validity and influence of various religious practices and cultures.
##### Economy and Currency
Thousands make pilgrimage to the Holy City each year, contributing massively to the country's growth and economic stability. The City is host to numerous religious festivals and 
##### Culture and Society 
Even prior to its annexation into the Draymond Empire, Nassau was always regarded as the centre of modern religion. 

Despite its connection and proximity to Draymond, Nassau is among the few countries to have maintained a stance of neutrality for as long as it has been around. This has had many societal implications. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The most history landmark outside of the Holy City and perhaps one of the most famous landmarks in the world 

Titan Rock
##### Settlements & Structures
The Holy City itself is naturally the largest settlement in the country, accounting for the vast majority of the population and receiving significant expansion and development as the centuries progress. 

While under the protection of Draymond, the city has never known to have been besieged or attacked by a foreign army. 

##### Military and Naval Power 
Thousands of Paladins and Clerics reside locally within the City itself

The **Veiled Paladins of Nassau** are an elite order sworn to serve as the guardians and enforcers of the Holy City and the will of the clergy. Known for their distinctive veiled helmets, they are both revered and feared; their veils symbolize anonymity and submission to the gods, removing individuality and emphasizing their role as instruments of the Holy City rather than independent beings. The process of becoming a Veiled Paladin is gruelling, requiring years of rigorous physical training, religious instruction, and ritualistic purification designed to strip recruits of their personal ambitions and attachments. 

Once inducted, Veiled Paladins serve in various roles within Nassau’s hierarchy. They act as guardians of the city’s temples and the Pantheon’s High Council, military commanders in holy campaigns, and emissaries of the gods when Nassau’s authority is challenged. Their loyalty to the Holy City is absolute, and their very presence is often enough to command silence or compel obedience.

---
### Skaldava
##### Population and Demographics
As could be expected of the Black Empire's principal vassal state, Skaldava is principally composed of Humans and Ende'hel. 
##### History and Founding
For almost a millennia, the nation of Skaldava was divided by warring tribes of Giants. They were all driven off by Human settlers in the Age of Mist, who effectively replaced them, even going so far as to occupy their abandoned campsites and hovels, and eventually warring for them also. 

Throughout the Age of Mist, the Skaldavan people were 
##### Economy and Currency
Though not a particularly affluent country, the economy of Skaldava has always been tied to its land; agriculture dominates, with barley, oats, and rye being the primary crops. These grains, hardy enough to withstand the region’s harsh climate, are supplemented by root vegetables and the grazing of livestock. Sheep farming is particularly prominent, with Skaldavan wool valued for its warmth and durability, and the rough terrain and wet climate also made cattle and pigs staples of local farming, providing meat and leather for trade.

Much of Skaldava’s wealth is siphoned off by Draymond as part of its vassalage, but local markets still thrive in rural areas, often operating on barter systems or using the old Skaat coinage. Forestry and peat harvesting, while secondary industries, are equally vital; the woodlands supply timber for construction and fuel, while the marshes yield peat, fish and reeds for thatching. These resources, though modest, have sustained the kingdom through many centuries of famine and war. 

Trade has historically been limited to neighbouring regions, with surplus grain, wool, and dried fish being the primary exports. The rivers play a key role in internal trade, allowing goods to be transported from rural villages to larger towns and beyond.
##### Culture and Society 
Skaldavan culture is deeply rooted in the land. For centuries, the people have lived in close harmony with the rhythms of the seasons, their lives shaped by the demands of the fields and the unforgiving winters.
##### Geography and Landmarks 
Skaldava is a land of damp summers and harsh winters, defined by its rolling plains, fertile river valleys, and rugged highlands. The Bryndal and Velun Rivers serve as the lifeblood of the region, their waters sustaining crops and connecting settlements. Between them lies the heartland of Skaldava, a vast expanse of farmland dotted with villages and keeps.

The mountain range known as the White Wall has long divided the lands of Skaldava and Draymond to the west. Subterranean passageways and overland roads were built through the mountains to facilitate the travel during winter, which is often very harsh in Skaldava and would otherwise render the natural pathways impassable. These were, of course, built at Imperial decree, and on Skaldava's dime. 
##### Settlements & Structures
Arkemund Keep, the nation's most famed 

Velunford, located at the junction of the Bryndal and Velun Rivers, serves as a vital trade hub and a waypoint for goods traveling downstream. Its residents, known for their resourcefulness, build sturdy boats and repair tools for farmers and traders.

The countryside is dotted with hamlets and farmsteads, many fortified with simple palisades or earthworks.
##### Military and Naval Power 
Born from the ruins of the Doyverd Empire, it rose as a unified kingdom under the Velun Kings. For centuries, it prospered, its fertile lands supporting a growing population and its natural defenses deterring invaders. However, this prosperity also bred ambition, culminating in its ill-fated attempt to expand into Draymond’s territory—a campaign that ended in its subjugation.

Skaldava has always been a key player in the Black Empire’s military expansions; its people, accustomed to hardship and skilled in the use of the axe and bow, became the backbone of Draymond’s armies during the conquests of Einartoft and Nydessa. Skaldavan soldiers earned a reputation for their endurance and tenacity, though this came at a great cost to their homeland as entire generations were lost to war, leaving villages depopulated and fields underattended for decades.

### Florence
##### Population and Demographics 
The majority population of Florence is Humans, followed closely by Ende’hel and Mirende’hel, many of whom migrated following the Serende’hel Reformation A minority population of Lithfolk also reside here after many migrated from the Westerlands during the spread of Bloodfire in 342SR. 
##### History and Founding
Florence was founded in the fertile valleys of southern Dol-Calandria by refugees fleeing the collapse of the Doyverd Kingdom. This early settlement quickly grew into a prosperous city-state, thanks to its rich agricultural lands and strategic location. The Florentines, known for their expertise in viticulture and trade, transformed their homeland into a haven of culture and refinement. The capital city, La Fiora, became renowned for its stunning architecture, lush vineyards, and thriving artistic community.  

In 225BR, the Empire, eager to expand its influence and secure the fertile southern territories, launched a military campaign against Florence. The invasion was led by Einartoft, a constituent country within the Empire, whose disciplined and battle-hardened forces overwhelmed Florence’s defences after two years of intense conflict; in 223BR, Florence was formally annexed by the Draymond Empire. The once-independent city-state became a vassal, with its Grand Duke swearing fealty to the Emperor. While the Florentines mourned the loss of their sovereignty, they quickly adapted to their new status, using their wealth and cultural influence to secure favourable terms within the Empire.

Florence’s integration into the Draymond Empire also brought political stability and access to broader markets. The Florentine people, though no longer independent, adapted to Imperial rule by emphasising their cultural contributions and ensuring that La Fiora remained a beacon of art and refinement. This relationship between Florence and the Empire grew into one of mutual benefit, with Florence becoming a jewel in the Empire’s crown.

The Serende'hel Reformation, a period of intellectual and cultural renaissance that swept through Valanar, had a profound impact on Florence. The Ende’hel found in Florence a kindred spirit; the elves brought with them knowledge of advanced agricultural techniques and a deep appreciation for the arts, both of which were eagerly embraced by the Florentines.
##### Economy and Currency
Florence is possibly the most affluent country in Dol’Calandria; as a vassal state, Florence maintained a degree of autonomy, particularly in matters of culture, agriculture, and local governance, and though the Grand Duke’s power was limited, the Florentine nobility managed to retain their luxurious lifestyles by aligning themselves with the interests of the Empire. Florence became a key supplier of fine wines, luxury goods, and agricultural products to the Empire, and its economy continued to thrive under Imperial protection.

Tourism is a large source of income for the country, with many hotels, bath houses and a handful of world famous restaurants. Many travel from far and wide to spectate the plays and pantomimes that are hosted in the capital city’s eponymous amphitheatre, Selene’s Forum.  
##### Culture and Society 
Florentine society is highly stratified with a powerful aristocracy followed by wealthy merchants, artisans, and the common folk; including farmers and labourers. Nobles and wealthy families often live in grand estates or on vineyards that stretch for miles, while the lower classes reside in charming, though modest, villages and towns.

The "vividism" art movement is largely attributed to Florentine artists Danielle Du'Bois and Francis Van Loch, who spent approximately eight years travelling around the country and painting extraordinarily detailed still-life paintings and landscapes. 

Nobility plays a central role in Florentine society. The aristocracy adheres to a strict code of honour and chivalry, which influences everything from politics to personal relationships. Knights and nobles often partake in jousting, tournaments and duels where the honour of their houses and patrons are defended, and prestige is won.
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The landscape is dominated by gently rolling hills and fertile valleys, ideal for vineyards, olive groves, and grain fields. The temperate climate, with hot summers and mild, wet winters, supports a long growing season, perfect for the region’s renowned agriculture.

There are three great rivers which run through the entirety of Florence, each named after each wife of the country’s first king. The rivers meet 
##### Settlements & Structures
The capital city is La Fiora, which is a walled city built onto an island which separates the three great rivers which run through the country. 

The Golden Valley is Located along the Maristella River, a region world-famous for its vineyards and wine production as well as ludicrously expensive manors and plantations.
##### Military and Naval Power 
Each House in Florence typically employs a small guard who frequently work alongside the royal garrison as well as the hold knights, depending on the House’s wealth.

With no navy to speak of, Florence does not spend much of its gold maintaining a standing army, instead relying on its levy tax in times of need, as well as the reinforcements from the Draymond Empire.

### Morovia
##### Population and Demographics 
Shortly before the Serende’hel Reformation, a small population of Ende’hel settled in Lesser Morovia after landing on the Blythe Coast. 
##### History and Founding
Originally founded in 270BR as the Kingdom of Greater Witzia, the country experienced a turbulent history marked by a civil war that eventually led to its division into Lesser Morovia and the Blythe Coast. Lesser Morovia retained the highland territories, developing a distinct cultural identity shaped by its isolation and the rugged landscape.
##### Economy and Currency
Morovia’s economy is largely based on its rich natural resources, particularly animal produce and hunting trophies, which are highly prized in neighbouring regions. Leatherworking and fur trade are significant economic activities, supplemented by small-scale agriculture suited to the highland climate. The currency, the Morovian Taler, is adorned with the reigning monarch on one side and a depiction of their chosen animal on the other. 
##### Culture and Society 
Life is simple in Morovia; the majority of the population live in self sufficient communities and hamlets outside of the capital city, Kolkev. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The Morovian Highlands are teeming with wild game and

### Blythe Coast
##### Population and Demographics 
The Blythe Coast is a relatively small nation principally composed of Human settlements and predominantly inhabited by mixed populations of Elves and Dwarrow. Though its population is modest compared to other imperial nations, its cultural density is high. 

In the shallow shoals and tidepools are glasscrabs—translucent crustaceans with venomous barbs and an uncanny ability to camouflage—harvested cautiously for their alchemical value.
##### History and Founding
The Blythe Coast was founded as part of the Kingdom of Greater Witzia, but following a brutal civil war known as the Witzian Civil War, it split into the independent regions of Lesser Witzia (Morovia) and the Blythe Coast. Renowned for its seafaring culture 

**Witzian Civil War**
In 330BR, 
##### Economy and Currency
Blythe is known first and foremost for its shipbuilding industry, producing durable vessels highly regarded for their ability to navigate treacherous coastal waters. Carpenters and joiners 

The region also exports preserved foods, like salted fish and smoked meats, leveraging its natural resources and expertise in preservation techniques to the benefit of the empire. 
##### Culture and Society 
Fishing and seafaring is central to the way of life in Blythe, and nearly every family has some involvement in these industries, if not in carpentry and joinery. Blytheans ships are often adorned with intricate carvings that depict sea creatures and local myths. 

Social hierarchies are less rigid than in neighbouring regions, largely due to the pragmatic nature of the population, where skills and experience are valued over noble lineage. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The Blythe Coast itself is dominated by towering chalk cliffs carved by millennia of relentless waves, forming a rugged and imposing coastline that is as beautiful as it is treacherous. The cliff tops are windswept and wild, dotted with hardy grasses and colourful wildflowers that cling to the thin, chalky soil. Beneath the cliffs, the sea continues its unending assault, slowly shaping the coast and revealing ancient fossils embedded within the rock. Scaling these cliffs and harvesting the eggs of the

### Caldwynn
##### Population and Demographics 
The population of Caldwynn is predominantly Human, making up the vast majority of its inhabitants. Orcs, who have long lived in the mountainous regions to the north, form the largest minority group. Relations between the two races have historically been amicable, shaped more by necessity than by mutual respect. Orcish communities maintain a semi-autonomous existence in the highlands, engaging in trade with the Human lowlanders and occasionally providing warriors to the kingdom's armies or laborers to its mines. Half-Orcs are a common sight in Caldwynn, particularly in border settlements where the two populations intersect.

Caldwynn’s plains and highlands are home to diverse wildlife: native horse breeds roam semi-wild while deer, boars, foxes, and hares populate the forests and fields, supporting the kingdom’s traditions of hunting and falconry. Wolves and other large predators lurk in the wilder reaches, including griffins who largely live in the mountain ranges along the Northern borders to Vitgaard; they are dangerous predators that are as much a threat to livestock as they are symbols of power in noble heraldry.  
##### History and Founding
Caldwynn’s origins lie in the chaotic migrations of the Age of Mists, when seafaring clans landed on its western shores. Drawn by the expansive plains and fertile lands, these clans established themselves as agrarian societies, quickly realizing that horses were the key to both prosperity and power. Caldwynn’s early history was marked by frequent conflict with neighbouring regions, as well as internal rivalries between the Horse Lords.
##### Economy and Currency
It’s no surprise that a large part of Caldwynn’s foreign exports include horses and riding paraphernalia;  with thousands of acres of open pasture and an excellent standard of care for their mounts, the relationship between not only horses but the horse lords and Caldwynn’s economy is in many ways interlinked. Leatherworking and blacksmithing are also prominent industries, producing fine saddles, bridles, and armour for both riders and their mounts.

Agriculture is equally important, with the plains yielding abundant grain crops such as wheat and barley. These staples, combined with the country’s livestock production, make Caldwynn a net exporter of food. The feudal system ensures that much of this wealth flows upward to the nobility, who reinvest it in their estates and military.
##### Culture and Society 
The inhabitants of Caldwynn have had a long history of taming and breeding the native population of stallions. 

Falconry and hunting are popular aristocratic pastimes; hunting on horseback is considered an excellent way to not only prove status but to keep their skills with a bow sharp. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The northern regions of Caldwynn are characterised by an abundance of hills and forests in which Griffons make nests and prey upon the horses that roam in the fields miles away. 

The Eastern Plains are known for being extensive flatlands dotted with farms, plantations and estates. 
##### Settlements & Structures
Capital City is Aragorn

Dun WIP, otherwise known as the School of the Falcon. 

##### Military and Naval Power 
Caldwynn boasts an impressive cavalry with heavy lancer and mounted archery divisions that dominate most light infantry formations. Its military prowess and strategic location made it both a regional power and a frequent target of foreign ambitions, yet its flat terrain and open skies ensured that its cavalry would always have the upper hand. Knights are the only military unity permitted to ride on horseback outside of these cavalry units. 

Caldwynn’s navy is easy to underestimate.

### Vitgaard
##### Population and Demographics 
As with most countries in Dol-Calandria, Vitgaard is inhabited mostly by Humans, seconded by Dwarrow, who migrated from Khard following the eruption of Mt. Zephyra after finding no asylum in Nauska. The Dwarrow proved an excellent ally in the expansion of Old Vitgaard and were afforded not only land but given full control over the country’s mining operations on the condition that they officially declare themselves as citizens of the empire. 
##### History and Founding
Vitgaard as it stands today traces its origins back to the Old Vitgaardian Empire, established shortly after the collapse of the Doyverd Kingdom around . Initially, the empire encompassed four distinct nations. 

In 230BR the Iron Revolt, a seminal event catalysed by Tzar Alexander’s controversial economic reforms, dramatically altered the course of Vitgaardian history. The Tzar, in an ill-fated attempt to diverge from the gold-standard currency of neighbouring countries, introduced an iron-based tender. This new currency was intended to foster economic independence but instead led to widespread financial disaster. The iron coins quickly flooded the market and were extensively devalued, leading to rampant inflation and a steep decline in purchasing power among the populace.

The initial stages of the revolution were marked by non-violent protests, including strikes and the spread of dissenting rumours as the citizenry voiced their growing discontent. However, the situation rapidly escalated as counterfeit iron coins, virtually indistinguishable from the official mint due to their low intrinsic value, exacerbated the economic chaos.

Amidst this turmoil, covert operatives from Draymond exploited the situation, playing a pivotal role in stoking the flames of rebellion across the Old Vitgaardian Empire. It is widely believed these Draymond spies were instrumental in orchestrating several key incidents during the revolution, including the tragic assassination of Tzar Alexander’s heirs.

From the ashes of the Old Vitgaardian Empire, a new era began with the appointment of a Praetor who managed to secure the loyalty of the fractured nation's leaders. By granting them sovereignty and amnesty for any revolutionary acts, the Praetor not only quelled the unrest but also laid the foundation for a new coalition. In response to the burgeoning threat from the Draymond Empire, which had recently annexed Witzia and the Blythe Coast, the Praetor initiated the Northern Concordat. This crucial pact united the nations of Nauska, Venizia, Vitgaard, and Brutayne under the banner of the Northern Independents, forming a formidable alliance against external aggression.
##### Economy and Currency
Where Draymond was built with gold, Vitgaard was founded on iron. The currency of Vitgaard is francs, which are iron coins denominated by coatings of copper, silver and gold. To other countries, they are known as ‘de-francs’ due to their debasement. 

Despite its size and the volume of its exports, Vitgaard is not an especially affluent country. The majority of its settlements and towns are built near local resources; Vitgaard has a strong mining culture, producing a large percentage of the world’s iron, steel and sulphur. Nearly all of the world’s most famous weaponsmiths come from or have studied in Vitgaard; when some of the country’s earliest Dwarrow settlers were made to produce arms for the country, they brought their expertise and mastery with them.   
##### Culture and Society 
Centuries of labour and toil have taught the citizens of Vitgaard that nothing is given, everything is earned. Vitgaardian children are often born into a lineage of tradesmen or labourers if not soldiers. 

Vitgaardian society has never been particularly egalitarian; for almost a millennia women were disbarred from entering into legal professions or politics and it was even also considered illegal for a woman to practise magic in Vitgaard, though this law was rarely enforced on anyone of consequence and is thought to have been implemented as another strict measure of control over the nation's supplicants. 

The weight of a newborn child is often used as a metric for giving gifts on their birth - noble families will often donate the child’s weight in iron, to be used in whichever way the child deems fit later in life - a small fortune, a weapon, or a suit of armour; depending on the size of their dowry, of course.  

##### Geography and Landmarks 

##### Settlements & Structures
The Capital City of Vitgaard is Kyovashod, a metropolitan jewel of the Northern realms. As the Tsar's seat of power 
##### Military and Naval Power 
Modern Vitgaard relies mostly on conscription to bolster its ranks, and as such, their tactics are usually based on war of attrition, throwing overwhelming numbers onto the enemy rather than outmanoeuvring them, however, prior to the dissolution of the Old Vitgaardian Empire, 

The vast majority of the peasantry are willing to defend their land with their lives, and as decreed by the Praetorian Edict in 10BR, all have the right to bear arms in the defence of their property, livelihood, and the state itself.

Vitgaard’s naval capabilities are primarily mercantile, with a significant presence of armed merchant vessels rather than a formal navy to represent the country on the seas. 

---
### Venizia
##### Population and Demographics 
Humans make up for a third of the population with a mixture of most, if not all of the other Higher Races accounting for the other two. Smaller populations of Glimmerhin and Vitgaardian-descended migrants also reside in Venizia, particularly in merchant and artisanal roles. While diverse, the population is united under Venizia’s focus on civic order and prosperity, ensuring a relatively harmonious coexistence between its people.
##### History and Founding
Founded sometime in the Age of Mists by Vitgaardian settlers as part of the kingdom of Old Vitgaard  following the Iron Revolt which led to the dissolution of the realm. Venizia’s rulers were free from Imperial mandates and enjoyed total sovereignty from that point forward, joining the Northern Concordat as a constituent of the Northern Kingdoms alongside their former rulers. 
##### Economy and Currency
While the vast majority of Venizia’s inhabitants use the same ducats as other countries, Venizian merchants are also known to accept precious gems as legal tender due to the kingdom’s long standing trade relationship with Khard. 

Venizia is an affluent city state, with a small portion of its population employed within infrastructural roles such as public healthcare and waste disposal.   

Migration to Venizia is a heavily regulated and bureaucratic process with many papers to sign and loops to jump through; entry to the country is restricted to licensed merchant vessels, students of the Royal College, and those entering on a worker’s permit with the intention of earning citizenship after a decade of service. 

Venizia is one of the few countries to enact restrictions on hunting, importing the majority of its animal produce. 
##### Culture and Society 
Venizian citizens enjoy a higher standard of living than many other countries in Dol’Calandria, given both its wealth and its history of social welfare. It is expected that what is given is also to be returned, and in a time where social unrest was at its highest as both Doyverd and Old Vitgaard collapsed, Venizia’s power and influence only grew, largely as a consequence of its united populace. 

Public education, healthcare, security and many common services come at a low price, if not for free to any Venizian citizen. While its people live under a government that controls most of their societal functions, they do so comfortably. Such freedoms do come at a cost, however, as 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
Venizia itself is a city state, and other than the farms and hamlets dotted around the island, the majority of its inhabitants reside within city limits. The island on which Venizia was built is part of an archipelago of islands known as the Venetian Isles, which the city was named after; its geography features low, rolling hills, fertile plains, and craggy cliffs which provide the isle with plenty of natural beauty and defensible positions. 
##### Settlements & Structures
Venizia itself is crisscrossed by **man-made canals**, designed by Dwarrow engineers to facilitate trade and water management. Gondolas and flat-bottomed boats are the primary means of transportation within the city.

The Royal College of Venizia was established by its first King after the dissolution of Old Vitgaard, intended to be the culmination of the country’s collective knowledge. 
##### Military and Naval Power 
Venizia keeps a well paid and well trained standing army to act as both their central judicial authority as well as law enforcement.

### Nauska
##### Population and Demographics 
The majority of the population of Nauska is represented by Kanin who have occupied the lands since long before Dol’Calandria was ever settled by Humans. Eldain bade

There is a significant minority of humans in Nauska, many of whom have settled in the lower valleys where agriculture is more feasible. These communities often act as trade intermediaries between the mountain-dwelling Kanin and outsiders, facilitating economic exchanges that benefit the region.
##### History and Founding
###### Sadao Shogunate
Nauska was once mostly unsettled land between the salt flats of Khard’s southern border and Old Vitgaard’s northern territories. For centuries, the Kanin clans had been embroiled in relentless civil wars, fighting over land, resources, and ancient grievances, and this protracted conflict had left Nauska fragmented and vulnerable. With the clans distracted and dispersed, the Old Vitgaardian Empire initiated a series of aggressive manoeuvres aiming to annex the country; their approach was both militaristic and strategic, posing a critical threat to the sovereignty and cultural integrity of the Kanin people. 

It wasn’t until this threat that the Kanin decided to draw their line in the sand. The legendary To Sadao stood at the summit of Mount Kaya and was proclaimed to be the strongest of the clan leaders; the Shogunate. Shortly afterwards, he had a chance to prove both his strength and tactical genius at the battle of Nayakami Bay after an uprising had been started, precipitated by the new Shogunate’s demand to open trade with foreigners - something previously unheard of in Kanin society. The uprising was quelled within weeks, and the rebellious upstarts who dared to refuse Sadao’s requests were put to death. 

Two more ports were opened during the Sadao Shogunate, both of which were closed following his death.   

Rotahn, The Enlightened was believed to have been a soldier in the battle of Nayakami Bay. 
##### Economy and Currency
Plates are the standard form of currency in Nauska; precious metals are smelted into thin rectangular bars with a hole in the middle for stacking onto an abacus. These plates can vary in size and weight but are standardised as 3x5 inches and weighing 1lb per plate for foreign trade. 

The Shogunate employs a structured approach to trade and resource management, maximising efficiency and state control over key assets. Socially, they promote meritocracy within the bounds of their stringent class system, allowing upward mobility for common Kanin who demonstrate exceptional ability, particularly in areas beneficial to the state such as military service, scholarship, or craftsmanship; Nauskan swordsmiths for example are particularly famous for their knowledge of katana forging and are often employed by the Shogunate. 

Markets are strictly regulated by the Shogunate and therefore free trade of various items are impermissible without paying tax on each transaction, however bartering with food is fairly commonplace and acceptable as far as open trade is concerned. 

Nauska has one port town which is used for trade with Brutayne and merchants from Drak’Thill known as Nayakami Bay. Foreign trade is 
##### Culture and Society 
The Kanin live relatively frugal lives and their culture of shared pragmatism and duty has kept Nauska unified throughout times of strife. Nauska is divided by fiefdoms which are governed by clans of samurai. The social disparity between a commoner and a member of the samurai class is more pronounced than the relationship between knight and peasant; the role of a samurai extends to law enforcement as well as martial duties; they serve as magistrates, tax collectors, and arbiters of justice. The social divide between commoner and samurai is absolute; even in death, their graves are segregated. Samurai are expected to live by the _Okaisha_, a doctrine of discipline, restraint, and loyalty, though in practice, political necessity often takes precedence over idealism.

Nauska’s leadership is likewise characterised by its pragmatic approach to governance, they are unyieldingly fair in their administration yet uncompromising in their enforcement of the law; a kind of authoritarianism which has maintained a strict control on cultural and intellectual fronts, with little room for dissent or deviation from the established order. Orthodoxy, whether in faith or form, is the expectation.

Daily life is steeped in ritual. Even the mundane is formalised: there are prescribed methods for pouring drink, sitting in company, addressing superiors, and walking through gates. Breaches in etiquette can have real social consequences, especially in courtly or military settings. For example, shirozu, which is a form of rice wine fermented in ceramic kilns and aged beneath the earth, is commonly enjoyed across all castes, but even its consumption is heavily codified; when shared, it must be poured by another, never by oneself, to pour for oneself implies arrogance or solitude—both socially suspect.

The Lady of Wolves, Goddess of The Hunt, holds a special place in the Kanin spiritual imagination. Her shrines, often built near roads or in wooded glades, serve as quiet gathering points for offerings of grain, pelts and bone, as well as shirozu. Hunting, fishing, and dry-field farming form the backbone of Kanin subsistence; though their diet is plain, they consume in volume, owing to their lean, fast-burning physiques.

Perhaps as a consequence of their lithe physicality, Nauskan art is often considered extremely esoteric and is sought after by collectors and art patrons the world over. 

Bloodlines and ancestry are often seen as the primary means of not only conflict but also categorising social groups; peasant families rarely rise beyond their station and powerful clans stay powerful for as long as there is someone in the family carrying the banner. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The trees in Nauska are famously very tall, 

The lakes of Nauska are rich with gold, leading many to take up gold panning.
There are several species of sweet plants and fruits which are native to Nauska. 

Nauska sees more rainfall on average than most other countries per year, resulting in canyons and valleys that flood and drain throughout the seasons. This has many ecological implications including the hibernation and migration patterns of not only the
##### Settlements & Structures
The capital of Nauska is Doku, the only settlement large enough to be considered a city by the standards of any other country. Doku was the birthplace and fiefdom of Lord Sadao before he established it as his seat of power during his period as Shogun. 

Shrines to Eldain are particularly common throughout the Nauskan highlands. The mountains are viewed as sacred territory and as a result poaching or hunting without a writ of permission from a local Lord is considered a serious crime. 

Due to the mountainous terrain, most Kanin settlements are sprinkled throughout the peaks and valleys. 

The villages closer to the borders ar inhabited by a higher percentage of Humans and act as proxies for trade with Vitgaard and Khard by extension. 
##### Military and Naval Power 
###### Samurai Clans
Nauska does not have a standing army however each of the clans often have hundreds of samurai on retainer to act as their day to day peacekeeping force as well as levys conscripted by their Feudal Lord.

The feudal lords of Nauska employ a stern, iron-fisted approach to law and order with a deep commitment to justice and equity. While they champion the arts and intellectual pursuits, their governance is underpinned by a strong, centralised authority that does not hesitate to enforce its will to maintain stability and control. Their rule is dictatorial when necessary, especially in matters of security and law enforcement, ensuring that their directives are executed without fail.  

The Kanin have established a distinct societal structure where the Samurai class enjoys privileges and responsibilities far removed from those of the common Kanin. Samurai serve not only as military and administrative officers but also as arbiters of the Shogunate’s laws and enforcers of its will. They are educated in the Hanari academies, where they learn the arts of governance, diplomacy, and military strategy, in stark contrast to the commoners who are more often engaged in agriculture, craftsmanship, and trade. 

The main cornerstone of life as a Samurai is the Okaisha, a doctrine written by the famous warrior monk Rotahn the Enlightened, which emphasises honour in verbal and physical combat, loyalty to the clan, and personal discipline. However, the reality is often more pragmatic than idealistic; many Samurai bend the rules to serve their own interests or the shifting needs of their clan, and while there are those who genuinely seek to live by the code, the pressures of warfare, politics, and internal clan strife make such purity rare. In truth, the Okaisha serves more as an aspirational guideline than a rigid set of rules; the Samurai are frequently faced with situations where strict adherence to the code would be impractical or even disastrous for their survival. Deception, strategic dishonesty, and opportunistic behaviour are not unheard of, especially in the complex web of inter-clan politics. 

The Kanin have a deeply intimate understanding of space and distance and this enables them to use the mountainous terrain of Nauska to their ultimate advantage, making it virtually impossible for foreign invaders to adapt; their preference for hit and run style ambushes works against any type of infantry, even other Kanin. 

Commoners are permitted ownership and open carry of swords as long as they are hiltless as well as being both worn on the back and concealed within a cloth bag in order to increase their draw time - fractions of seconds that could spell the difference between life and death. This policy was enacted by the Hanari Shogunate as both a means to militarise the populace as well as reduce the rates of impulsive violence - especially between commoners and the samurai themselves - and has has impacted Kanin society impermeably; 

The Kanin have an extremely small naval force, with only one operational port out of Nayakami Bay.

### Terracotta Landmass
##### Population and Demographics 
Hundreds of species of animals, beasts and insects intermingle in the humid and layered ecosystem of the Landmass, with Humans and other Higher Races inhabiting small coastal cities. Unlike the structured empires of Dol-Calandria or the warlike federations of the North, the Terracotta region remains stubbornly unconquered, populated by a scattering of coastal city states, independent jungle enclaves and hidden settlements; civilised population is loosely divided between coastal traders, jungle-dwelling clans, and river people who live along the vast arterial deltas that cut through the heart of the landmass.

Enormous canopy-dwelling gorvians, six-limbed arboreal hunters with chitinous skin and phosphorescent eyes, reign over the upper treetops. Below them, in the mud-slick undergrowth, slink the ghem-brutes, slow-moving predators covered in bone plates and trailing toxic fungi from their backs. Bloodvine constrictors lie in wait for weeks on branch or root, capable of dislocating their own spines to mimic the twist of bark.
##### Economy and Currency
The civilisations that do exist in the Landmass are primarily feudal and depend on local barter and foreign trade with Drak'Thill and Tohren Isle to sustain themselves; the coastal Free Cities in particular thrive as crossroads of international trade, piracy,

The Landmass is rich in rare resources: alchemical reagents, exotic fauna, medicinal flora, dyes and narcotics; foreign merchants, particularly from Draymond, Tohren Isle, and Drak'Thill, pay handsomely for the privilege of trade.

### Tohren Isle
##### Population and Demographics 
Tohren Isle is home to two primary groups: **Humans** and **Hilgyr (or Gyr)**. The Gyr, hulking humanoid giants, have coexisted peacefully with Humans for thousands of years. This longstanding alliance is rooted in mutual respect, with the Gyr providing physical labor, craftsmanship, and guardianship, while Humans contribute organizational skills, agriculture, and trade. The population of the island is small, numbering fewer than 50,000, with Humans forming the majority. Gyr tend to live in **tribal enclaves** scattered across the island but remain integrated with human society.

### The Elven Isle
##### Population and Demographics 
As the island’s name implies, the Elven Isle consists almost entirely of Ende’hel, with a minority population of Enadriel (approximately one quarter of the total population by 1000SR). Until the Age of Man, entry to the country was heavily monitored at every port; as a result, Humans and other races are often viewed with varying degrees of suspicion or even outright hostility in more rural areas of the country. 
##### History and Founding
Previously thought to be uninhabitable by Draymondian cartographers, the Elven Isle was discovered by charter boats on the northern sea. It remains unknown whether or not there were other inhabitants of the island before the Ende’hel made it their home in the Age of Ascension, though there is evidence to suggest an outpost or similar structure was erected by sailors from the Doyverd Kingdom before being abandoned and eventually destroyed by the weather. 

By the time the Serende’hel Reformation came to pass there were thousands of Ende'hel who had decided to remain in Draymond after having fully integrated into Dol’Calandrian society; many spread outward to other parts of the world and found new homes, however, many had also died fighting the Empire’s battles, and an increasing number of Ende’hel grew malcontented as tensions began to bubble. Tairon Silverbark, the Lord of the Elves, was eventually granted passage and rewarded all of the resources he had been promised almost a century prior, and the thousands of Ende’hel who had remained with their lord once again set off toward foreign shores under his leadership. 

The elves became masters of their environment, developing architectural techniques to withstand the island’s natural disasters and agricultural practices that ensured self-sufficiency. Their society was structured around a loose caste system, with different roles assigned based on magical ability, knowledge, and contributions to the community. 

Shortly after the construction of New Tairon, the Ende’hel were swift to their borders and enacted various isolationist policies to protect the cultural homogeneity of their newfound home. 
##### Economy and Currency
The currency of the Elven Isle is the Endelian Denar, which is a gold plated coin which comes in denominations of one, two, five and ten denar. They are thinner than a Draymond ducat by half an inch and the vast majority of the coins in circulation contain a depiction of Tairon Silverbark on one side and the national emblem on the other. 

While the isle itself is plenty rich in beauty, it isn’t known for having any particularly rare natural resources save for perhaps jadestone and a particularly fragrant halite which is collected from coastal estuaries. 
##### Culture and Society 
One need only take a cursory look at Ende’hel society to see a trend toward a more meritocratic society than any other race, similar to their Enadriel cousins; their pragmatic and egalitarian approach to governance has formed a 

The average diet of an Elven commoner consists of fish, rice and a handful of native vegetables.

Despite the island’s relatively small surface area, there are two mountains to the north and south of the country which are regarded as sacred landmarks; Mt. Astrid and Mt. Kalan, the latter being a dormant volcano. Much of the fertile ground

## Dol-Calenon

### Brutayne
##### Population and Demographics 
Much like Dol-Calandria, Brutayne accounts for a significant portion of the Human population with a few of the other higher races following closely behind, namely the Dwarrow and the Orkryn, but also a healthy population of Lithfolk as well, given the country's proximity to the Westerlands. 

In the North Western regions, a large, relatively homogenous population of Ende'hel and Enadriel have occupied the forests and woodland areas for thousands of years. 
##### History and Founding
Brutayne was first "founded" as a kingdom two centuries before the Serende'hel Reformation, but had long existed as a nation of feudal lords and petty kingdoms that originated from along the River Brut. 
##### Economy and Currency
As the largest kingdom in the world, Brutayne has a major role to play in global economics and trade. The Kingdom acts as a trade partner for the Westerlands and was a strong unifying force for the countries of the Northern Concordat; facilitating military and trade alliances between all of the Northern Kingdoms as a response to the growing threat of Draymond's expansions in Dol'Calandria.

### The Westerlands
##### Population and Demographics 
Predominantly Halflings, with some Humans and a minor population of Ende’hel. The Halflings, also known as Lithfolk, form one of the world's most homogenous societies, thriving in the warm climate that suits their physicality​.
##### Economy and Currency
Very affluent country, exporting lots of produce, artisan and animal products each year. With few wars or conflicts to speak of, the Westerlands has always been prosperous and well known for 
##### Culture and Society 
The Lithfolk largely follow the Old Faith, 

The judicial system is operated by the clergy and is the only governing body of authority with the power to arbitrate over executive decisions and laws passed by regional leaders i.e Guild Leaders. They likewise have the power to arrest or execute lawbreakers at their discretion. Their society is structured around a loose but functional caste system. At the top are the Merchants' Guilds, which control trade networks, both legal and illicit. Beneath them are artisans and traders, and at the base are laborers and farmers, though even they participate in trade.
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The Westerlands are characterized by rolling green hills, fertile plains, and scattered woodlands. The region’s temperate climate and rich soil make it ideal for farms and vineyards.

##### Military and Naval Power 
The Westerlands lack a formal military, having little history of warfare. Instead, they rely on their wealth and alliances for security. In times of threat, guerilla militias formed by the Lithfolk and mercenaries funded by the Trade Guilds protect their homeland. Peacekeeping forces ensure local order, while their strong economic ties to Brutayne provide additional leverage in diplomacy; what they lack in physical stature, they are more than prepared to account for any situation through exorbitant spending on defences and political alliances.

### The Unforgiving Lands
##### Population and Demographics
The Unforgiving Lands are aptly named, for almost no one willingly makes their home in this barren, icy expanse. However, for those few souls who do reside in the frozen north, survival is a testament to their resilience. The population is predominantly Human, though there are healthy portions of Dwarrow, Glimmerhin, and Orkryn who eke out a living amid the frost and the towering forests. 

The harsh conditions attract only those hardened by nature or necessity. Many are descendants of ancient settlers, born into this land where the bitter cold has etched itself into their bones. Nomadic clans, pirates, and reavers also occasionally pass through, finding temporary refuge in the more accessible southern regions before pushing deeper into the wilderness or retreating southward.
##### Economy and Currency
There is no formal economy in the Unforgiving Lands. Barter is the only means of trade between the scattered, isolated groups who brave the icy wastelands. There are no established markets or currency, and coin holds little value in a place where survival depends on warmth and sustenance. What little commerce exists is conducted in goods such as fur, meat, firewood, and other essentials. 

The seaports along the southern coast attract the occasional pirate or reaver, and the trade that does occur is often tainted by violence and exploitation. Those who venture here to trade do so at great personal risk, for the roads are treacherous, and the cold is relentless, with little to gain from the exchange besides mere survival.
##### Culture and Society
The society of the Unforgiving Lands is defined by a brutal reality: only the strong and the cunning survive. In this land, there is no overarching government or ruling body; instead, scattered clans, small settlements, and nomadic tribes form loose, tenuous communities. The harsh environment fosters a culture of independence and self-reliance, where every man, woman, and child must contribute to the community’s survival. The people here are deeply pragmatic, with no room for idealism. They value hard work, resourcefulness, and above all, endurance.

There are whispered legends of the forgotten kingdom in the far northern mountains, a realm of ice dragon lords and dark gods. The people of the Unforgiving Lands still hold fragments of these old myths in reverence, and some secretive cults devoted to these forgotten powers exist in the deeper wilderness, where even the harshest elements cannot reach. In the more isolated areas, the smallfolk maintain ancient traditions, passed down through generations, honouring the frozen earth and its unseen spirits.
##### Geography and Landmarks
The Unforgiving Lands stretch across a vast, arctic landmass, bordered to the north by freezing mountains shrouded in perpetual mist. These mountains are said to be the last bastion of the old forgotten kingdom, whose ruins lie buried beneath the ice, hidden from all but the most daring or foolish adventurers. Beyond these peaks, at the very tip of the world, lies the Sea of Eldraga, a frozen, treacherous ocean believed to be home to the last of the ice dragons—ancient creatures that once ruled the skies with the mages of the forgotten kingdom.

The southern border of the Unforgiving Lands is marked by a series of fortresses and watchtowers maintained by Brutayne, whose forces guard the border between the southern realms and the freezing north. Beyond these towers, thick forests stretch for miles, home to isolated smallfolk and trappers who occasionally trade with Brutayne’s soldiers. Past the woods lies the Frozen Wastes, a barren, wind-swept desert of ice where temperatures plummet far below freezing, and few have dared to venture. Scattered throughout this wasteland are the ruins of old human settlements, remnants of an age when brave explorers sought to push northward in hopes of discovering riches, only to be consumed by the ice.
##### Settlements and Structures
Settlements in the Unforgiving Lands are few and far between, and those that exist are often little more than hardened outposts clinging to the edge of civilization. Brutayne's fortifications mark the most southern of these structures, a line of towers and walls designed to protect the warmer realms from the dangers of the north. Just beyond this fortified border, in the dense woods, are a few small settlements where hardy smallfolk live in symbiosis with the land, foraging and hunting while trading sporadically with Brutayne’s garrison.

Further north, near the coastline, are a few sea ports, each a den of pirates, slavers, and reavers, who use these locations as staging points for their raids. Life in these ports is harsh and lawless, with power determined by strength and cunning rather than law or lineage. Beyond the coast, at the heart of the freezing mountains, are the ruins of the forgotten kingdom—Varakhal, the once-great city of ice dragon lords. This city, now buried beneath layers of snow and ice, is said to be the seat of unimaginable power, where the last kings of the north once communed with dark gods and ruled over the land with the help of ancient, powerful magic.
##### Military and Naval Power
There is no organised military force in the Unforgiving Lands aside from the fortifications manned by Brutayne. These border garrisons are the first and last defence against any incursions from the north, though their role is primarily to prevent the dangers of the Frozen Wastes from spilling southward. The soldiers of Brutayne are hardened veterans, accustomed to the bitter cold and well-versed in holding their positions against both the natural dangers of the region and the occasional raids from reavers.

The seaports along the coast have their own form of military power, though it is more accurately described as pirate fleets and raiding parties. These ships are crude but effective, and they raid the nearby shores when the seas aren’t frozen over, returning to their hidden ports to split the spoils of their conquests. They are not a coordinated force but a loose confederation of opportunistic crews, led by charismatic captains who hold sway through violence and the promise of plunder.

### Einartoft
##### Population and Demographics 
Most of the land is occupied by Humans, especially in the southernmost parts of the country, however plenty of Orkryn and Half Orcs live in the northern regions. There is a significant population of Gnifalgyr who occupy the mountainous areas of the Primordial Valley and the Foreverwinter Tundra. 
##### History and Founding
Einartoft was settled by nomads from all across Dol-Calandria sometime during the Doyverd Empire as part of an expedition led by Lord Kel Salvatore, the brother-in-law of Emperor Darius Salvatore. 

The mountain regions of Einartoft were originally inhabited by Orcs and Giants, who constantly feuded over territory and the fertile ground at the base of the Primordial Valley. The Orcs received significant military aid from the Humans and the Giants were overthrown soon after, establishing the first of many victories shared between the two species. 

Native tribes of barbarians who were known to worship old Gods, contemporary beings of great strength from the mythology of their ancestors, were initially extremely resilient to foreign invasion and wrought havoc upon Lord Kel’s ranks. They proved a great hindrance to the initial settling, attacking supply lines and setting up traps along well-travelled roads. In spite of the counsel given by his Generals, Lord Kel subscribed to a rather famously bold tactic; he travelled with a small contingent of personal bodyguards to one of the largest camps of barbarians belonging to the Einar Tribe, where he was led to their chieftain. Outnumbered almost one hundred to one, the barbarian lord humoured the brash young lord to a private audience, where Kel proved himself both a wise negotiator and talented orator; 
##### Economy and Currency
Historically, Einartoft has never been a particularly affluent country; despite this, or perhaps as a consequence, 
##### Culture and Society 
Life in Einartoft demands fortitude. From the southern cities to the isolated northern tundras, every citizen is taught from a young age the importance of self-reliance. Even the smallest settlements are equipped to function autonomously, with every member of the community contributing to their survival; whether hunting, fishing, logging, or crafting, every skill has its place, and laziness is considered a grave dishonor.

The Einartoftian people are known for their stoicism. While Einartoft is unified under the Snow Crown, much of its society operates on a clan-based system. Each clan, whether large or small, serves as an extended family unit. Loyalty to one’s clan is paramount, and disputes between clans are often settled through traditions like **pugging** or **grudge drinking** to avoid all-out bloodshed. Clan meetings are frequent and serve as both a way to resolve conflicts and a chance to celebrate collective victories.

The bond between clans and families is particularly strong in the northern regions, where survival often hinges on cooperation. While this loyalty can sometimes manifest as mistrust toward outsiders, it also reinforces a sense of identity and pride.

Hospitality is considered a great virtue in Einartoftian society; on a land where a snowstorm can kill an unprepared traveller, offering shelter and sustenance to a stranger is seen as both a moral obligation and a point of pride - inns and taverns often double as communal gathering spaces. The Dwarrow and Orkryn, both prominent minorities in Einartoft, have deeply influenced these traditions, adding their own customs to the shared cultural tapestry.
##### Geography and Landmarks 

**Primordial Valley**
Dominating the eastern edge of Einartoft, the Primordial Valley is a sacred expanse of towering peaks and glacier-fed rivers. These mountains are believed to be the resting places of ancient Titans and are said to still hum with faint magical energy, remnants of battles long past. Among these peaks lies **Urnthorr**, the tallest mountain in all of Einartoft, often shrouded in mist and feared by climbers for its treacherous weather and hidden crevasses. Legends speak of creatures that have never been seen elsewhere dwelling within its caves.

**Foreverwinter Tundra**
The heart of Einartoft is the Foreverwinter Tundra, a seemingly endless stretch of snow-covered plains and dense, frostbitten woods. Known for its relentless cold and biting winds, the tundra is dotted with isolated settlements like **Gigantone**, which serves as a border town near the Orkryn territories. The tundra's unique beauty hides its dangers; storms can last for weeks, and predators such as winter wolves and wendigos are known to stalk unwary travelers.

**The Frozen Coast**
The western edge of Einartoft is lined by the **Frozen Coast**, where jagged cliffs and icy beaches meet the frigid waters of the northern sea. The small port town of **Quill** serves as a gateway for trade and seafaring expeditions, though the treacherous waters are often plagued by rogue waves and icebergs. It is also home to the infamous **Gorenna Castle**, a crumbling stronghold perched precariously on a cliff, said to be haunted by the spirits of its fallen defenders.

**The Frostfall Glades**
Nestled between the towering peaks of the Foreverwinter range, the **Frostfall Glades** are an ancient forest where the snow never melts. This region is home to towering pine trees, some thousands of years old, and is considered sacred by the indigenous tribes who still worship the Old Gods. Stories persist of glowing lights that guide travelers through the glades or, just as often, lead them to their doom.
##### Settlements & Structures

##### Military and Naval Power 
Centuries of conflict have shaped Einartoft into a martial society, where preparedness for war is seen as a necessary part of life. From a young age, children are taught basic survival skills and combat techniques, ensuring that every able-bodied citizen can contribute to the kingdom’s defense. While professional soldiers make up the bulk of Einartoft’s military, conscription during wartime is common, and many citizens take pride in their ability to fight for their homeland.

While their navy leaves much to be desired, Einartoft has always possessed a formidable military since its inception; the country itself being settled after generations of conquest and war. The Snow Kingdom uses conscription when engaged in wars, enforcing mandatory service from the ages of sixteen to eighteen for all of its citizens - in most cases, not even nobility are spared the draft, though they often occupy officer positions or more ministerial roles. 

Their preparedness for warfare is sparked by centuries of conflict with not only the many barbarian clans who roam the lawless valleys and tundras but also the Black Empire, who have historically attempted to reclaim their vassal state by force numerous times throughout the Ages.

### Skaal
##### Population and Demographics 
Many creatures call Skaal their home, despite the extreme temperature. Orcs, Humans and Giants are the three dominant races of Skaal, with the Humans and Orcs constantly struggling against the latter. 
##### History and Founding
The last of the barbarian clans not to be assimilated into the Snow Kingdom made their home in Skaal after being forced out of their lands and into exile. 

It remains a mystery who the original inhabitants of Skaal were, but it is believed to have been officially ‘settled’ at the height of the Doyverd Kingdom. 
##### Economy and Currency
Skaal’s economy is largely self-sustaining, with little in the way of exports due to its remote location and harsh climate. Most of the population lives off the land through fishing and small-scale lumber production, using the hardy trees that grow along the southern edges of the tundra. The scarcity of fertile land makes agriculture nearly impossible, so hunting and trapping are also crucial to survival. 

During the annual borealis thaw, when the ice temporarily recedes, traders from Einartoft and other regions arrive to barter goods. Pelts, whale oil, and frozen fish are exchanged for metals, tools, and preserved food. The citizens of Skaal typically rely on a barter system for local transactions, though rare trade goods are sometimes exchanged using coins.  
##### Culture and Society 
Skaal has few laws and many dangers; the climate alone would be enough to make settling there a challenge, let alone the presence of the Ice Gyr. Despite this, the citizens of Skaal are united in common strife, bound to watch over each other in tight knit communities; hardly thriving - but living all the same. 

Skaal natives are reportedly not as hostile to outsiders as one would imagine, mostly allowing anybody to migrate and settle in any plot of land that hasn’t been claimed by another, so long as they cause no trouble, of course. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
Skaal is dominated by a vast, frozen tundra that stretches for hundreds of miles, broken only by jagged mountain ranges and deep, snow-filled valleys. The landscape is harsh and unforgiving, with snowstorms that can last for days and temperatures that plummet far below freezing. The tundra itself is marked by enormous snowdrifts that form labyrinthine corridors, where even seasoned hunters can become lost during a storm.
##### Settlements & Structures
Due to the hostile environment, permanent settlements in Skaal are few and far between. Most of these are small, isolated villages, built into natural shelters such as caves or nestled in the shadow of mountain ranges to shield them from the worst of the winter winds. 

Some of the oldest man-made ruins lie in Skaal, preserved in a blanket of ice.

##### Military and Naval Power 
Skaal lacks a formalised military, as the inhabitants are too scattered and resources too limited to sustain a standing army. Instead, each clan or settlement is responsible for its own defence, and most able-bodied men and women are expected to fight when necessary. 

Naval power is likewise virtually non-existent due to the region’s ice-locked seas. However, small fishing boats are used during the borealis thaw, and on rare occasions, these boats are refitted for raids on rival settlements or passing ships.

## Dol-Volkhiir
### Khard
##### Population and Demographics 
Khard is the ancestral homeland of the Dwarrow, encompassing almost half of the continent of Dol’Volkhiir. Though the country was divided into Khard and Eastern Rakia some time in the Age of Mists, there has not been any indication found from salvaged records and accounts to suggest that they were ever at war with one another.

Enadriel make up a quarter of the population. Historically, the Enadriel who first travelled to Khard seeking asylum disagreed with Nashandra and struck out on their own, finding a successful relationship with the Dwarrow of Eastern Rakia. 

Khard is home to many species of chitinous creatures who resemble common insects (despite often being larger than most other creatures) who live in a delicate ecosystem with the Dwarrow. The carapaces and shells of these creatures are often valued highly for their many uses in construction and armour smithing. Certain species are even bred or captured specifically for labour or as a food source.  
##### History and Founding
Kard’Rhakthel (commonly abbreviated as ‘Khard’) was a Dwarven Kingdom which existed in the Age of Mists. While much of their history remains lost to the annals, it is well known that the continent was once a lush and verdant continent before the eruption of Mount Zephyra sometime around 500BR. 

Sometime after the eruption, small communities of surviving Dwarrow began to rebuild on the surface. 
##### Economy and Currency
While historically isolated in terms of global trade, Khard has thrived through its mastery of subterranean resources. The kingdom’s wealth is primarily derived from its extensive mining operations, which extract not only precious metals and gems but also rare minerals unique to its volcanic geography.

The Dwarrow of Khard have developed unique metallurgical techniques that allow them to create tools, weapons, and armour of unparalleled quality. 

Khard’s currency, the Rakian Steelmark, is minted from a rare alloy that can only be forged in the volcanic fires of Mount Rakia. This makes their currency incredibly durable and difficult to counterfeit.

##### Culture and Society 
Khard is a relatively homogenous society with many cultural differences to that of Dol’Calandria. 

The Dwarrow tend to be much more communal than other races, making Khard a very self-sufficient country on all fronts. On an observational note, Dwarrow are similar to Orkryn in that they lean toward tribalist tendencies, with males sometimes organising themselves into ‘firms’ or ‘families’ in which the most aggressive aspects of Dwarrow patriarchy rear their head.  

Each of the Great Houses controlled different sections of Khard as established and agreed upon by the first Four Kings of Kard’Rhakthel, a pact that stood until the Khard Civil War in 220SR.  
##### Geography and Landmarks 
Khard’s surface is a land of volcanic desolation, where life clings stubbornly to the ashen wastes, jagged obsidian ridges, and labyrinthine cavern mouths that mark the entrances to the undercities. Here, the air is thick with the scent of sulfur, and the ground trembles with the occasional distant groan of seismic unrest. It is an environment that has shaped not only its people but also the creatures that stalk its depths and wastes. The myriad of dangers and threats present in everyday life have forced every inhabitant of Khard to adapt in order to survive; the harsh climate, seismic activity and hostile wildlife all make Khard an impossible nation to control for any but its most ancient inhabitants. 

Mount Zephyra is the largest volcano in the world and its eruption caused a dramatic and permanent change to Khard’s geography; the northernmost parts of Khard remain both barren and completely covered in ash which combine with the often inclement weather to create ash clouds and black tornados, making the region extremely dangerous for the uninitiated. 

The south east quadrant of Khard is known as Eastern Rakia, named after Mount Rakia, the home of the Forgelords. Rakia was the only volcano not to be set off in the chain of eruptions catalysed by the eruption of Mount Zephyra, and many believe this to be as a result of the relationship the Forgelords have with their deity, Azamuth.  
##### Settlements & Structures
The few villages that are in Khard are usually built close to surface entrances to the nearest undercity. 

The largest of Khard’s undercities is Luperron, believed to have been named after the Dwarrow’s ancestral birthplace. Despite the relative wealth of each city, Dwarrow architecture has never been particularly flashy or focused on aesthetics; as one might expect, their focus instead lies in practicality and structural integrity. Signs are often carved into stone right above doorways as opposed to hanging overhead and the streets of their undercities are smooth pathways of abraded cobblestone. 
##### Military and Naval Power
Soldiers of Khard are trained to fight in the claustrophobic confines of undercities and tunnels. Their Wordbearers , often large and rectangular, are reinforced with volcanic metal from Mt. Rakia and feature intricate carvings that tell the stories of their Great Houses.

### Malyrian Isles
##### Population and Demographics 
The Malyrian Isles are functionally uninhabited. What remains of its population are scattered remnants; descendants of Dwarrow and Orkryn bloodlines who either refused to leave or were too changed by the Desolation to survive elsewhere. These individuals are few, isolated, and often regarded as mad or cursed by mainland societies. Some dwell in half-collapsed vaults or drift among the outer isles in scavenged vessels, clinging to ritual and memory. Others are nomadic, forming transient bands that follow ley surges or hunt spectral beasts for sustenance. There is no census, no governance, and no reliable record of who remains. Most who live here do so in secrecy, desperation, or devotion to forces long since abandoned by the rest of the world.

The Malyrian Isles are infested with creatures that defy taxonomy; beasts twisted by centuries of magical fallout, planar instability, and psionic corruption. These are not natural predators, but aberrations born from the Desolation itself. Some were once native fauna, warped beyond recognition by ley surges and arcane radiation. Others are planar spillovers, entities that slipped through the wound in reality and now stalk the land in search of sustenance, power, or escape.
##### History and Founding
The Malyrian Isles were first settled in the wake of the Great Exodus, when Dwarrow and Orkryn refugees—bound by the ancient Emberstone Pact—sought sanctuary from the divine upheavals that had shattered the old world. Their alliance, forged in the fires of Morrowsea and tempered by centuries of shared struggle, was more than political—it was cultural, spiritual, and deeply personal. Together, they established the Kingdom of Malyria, a hybrid civilization that blended Dwarrow engineering with Orkryn spiritualism. Its capital, Kar’Thendal, rose from the obsidian cliffs like a monument to unity, its towers forged from volcanic glass and its halls carved deep into the stone.

For centuries, Malyria thrived. Its forges burned with soulglass, its rituals echoed with ancestral power, and its scholars pushed the boundaries of arcane understanding. But ambition proved fatal. In their pursuit of metaphysical mastery, the kingdom’s leaders attempted a ritual known as **The Folding**—an experiment meant to merge psionic energy with the material plane. The result was catastrophic. The ley grid ruptured, the land screamed, and the Isles were torn apart in a single, apocalyptic moment.

This event, known as **The Desolation**, marked the end of Malyria. Kar’Thendal was shattered, the surrounding regions were poisoned, and the Emberstone Pact collapsed under the weight of grief and blame. The Isles were abandoned, cursed, and left to rot. What remains today is not a kingdom, but a ruin—a place where history lingers like smoke, and where the land itself remembers what was done to it.
##### Economy and Currency
In the broader geopolitical landscape, Malyria is a ghost. No nation claims it, no empire seeks to reclaim it. It exists as a scar on the map, a reminder of what happens when ambition outpaces wisdom.
##### Culture and Society 
There is no true culture left in Malyria—only fragments, rituals without context, and the hollow echoes of a civilization long dead. The Desolation didn’t just destroy cities and landscapes; it unraveled the social fabric of the Isles, leaving behind isolated individuals and broken enclaves that no longer share language, law, or purpose. What remains is survivalism at its most raw. Scavenger bands operate with brutal pragmatism, trading in relics and soulglass when they can, but more often raiding or scavenging from the ruins. The few remaining Dwarrow and Orkryn descendants have retreated into silence or madness, their traditions reduced to gestures and muttered prayers that no longer hold meaning.

There are no festivals, no councils, no shared myths—only superstition and fear. Some enclaves cling to distorted versions of ancestral rites, but these are often twisted by generations of isolation and trauma. Worship, where it exists, is directed not toward gods but toward the storm, the wound, or the land itself—forces that are neither benevolent nor comprehensible. Trust between groups is rare, and most interactions are hostile or transactional. Malyria is not a society—it is a graveyard of one, where the living persist only because they have not yet joined the dead.
##### Geography and Landmarks 
The Malyrian Isles are, for all intents and purposes, a dead land. The Desolation that tore through the region over two millennia ago left behind a shattered archipelago of obsidian wreckage, ley-scarred terrain, and toxic seas. What little remains of its once-great settlements are now half-submerged ruins, haunted by residual magic and the whispers of ancient catastrophe. The land itself is hostile—storms roll in without warning, the air is thick with psionic static, and the ground is unstable, prone to fissures and arcane surges. Most flora and fauna have either mutated or died out, and the few surviving species are predatory, spectral, or outright aberrant. 

Malyria is fractured not just physically, but metaphysically. The ley lines that once powered its forges and rituals now pulse erratically, causing unpredictable magical phenomena. Some scholars believe the Isles sit atop a planar wound—a place where the boundaries between realms were permanently torn. This theory is supported by sightings of spectral entities, time anomalies, and planar bleed-throughs that defy explanation.
##### Settlements & Structures
There are no true cities left in Malyria. The few enclaves that exist are either barely functioning or entirely cut off from the outside world. Travel between islands is perilous, with ley storms capable of tearing ships apart or warping time and space mid-voyage. The waters surrounding the Isles are considered cursed, and most naval charts mark the region as a void, unfit for trade, colonization, or exploration.
##### Military and Naval Power 
There is no organized military presence in Malyria. Defense is personal, improvised, and often ritualistic. Orkryn warbands still roam the coastlines, wielding ancestral weapons and storm-forged blades, their tactics shaped more by instinct and tradition than strategy. Dwarrow vaults are protected by ancient wards and mechanical traps, many of which still function despite centuries of neglect. Naval power is virtually nonexistent. The few vessels that traverse the cursed waters are scavenged, enchanted, or outright possessed—drifting between islands with no allegiance and no guarantee of return. Pirates, cults, and planar anomalies make sea travel nearly impossible, and most captains refuse to enter Malyrian waters at all. Those who do are either desperate, deluded, or damned.

### Nazkuga
##### Population and Demographics 
Nazkuga's climate and ecosystems are generally considered inhospitable and as such few sentient races reside there willingly; those who do live under extreme subjugation or in small, disparate conclaves. 

Nazkuga is principally populated with incredibly dangerous creatures and beasts who mostly have free roam over the entire land; Lordserpents and Arachyr being the two largest creatures to inhabit the land. 


##### Economy and Currency
Text here.
##### Culture and Society 
Nazkuga’s society is fragmented and harsh, with little to no cohesion between its various inhabitants. The country’s largest sentient demographic, the Pale Orcs live in tightly-knit, secretive conclaves beneath the surface, bound by tradition and a deep-seated mistrust of outsiders. Their society is tribal, with each conclave ruled by a council of elders who make decisions based on ancient customs and survival needs; whatever might appear as cohesion between these races from the outside is often little other than the newest iteration of a plot or scheme. 

The Vampire Lords, on the other hand, maintain a feudal system above ground, where they act as lords over small, isolated villages. These villages are grim places, where the human population lives in fear of their vampire masters. The culture here revolves around servitude and survival, with little room for joy or art. The vampires themselves are focused on maintaining their power and indulging in their dark appetites, rarely interacting with other lords unless driven by necessity.

## Sah’Raza
In the far east, the arid and sun scorched Sah'Raza desert is home to the nation of Drak'Thill and its surrounding Free Cities, as well as the Dry Sea.
### Drak’Thill
##### Population and Demographics 
There exists a population of Goblinoids who face rampant discrimination and abuse from the higher races, but are nonetheless allowed to reside within city limits and are even often sought after for menial labour (whether they like it or not). 

The Hado Tribes are a nomadic people who have passed down knowledge of the Hado through multiple generations, using it 
##### History and Founding

###### Doyverd Colonies
Drak'Thill is believed to have had no prehistoric inhabitants save for the many various species of wildlife that are native to its arid climate; during the height of Doyverd’s expansionist ambitions, the region now known as Sah’Raza was designated as a penal holding for castaway dissidents, failed generals, and debt-bound peasants beneath a sun that left little to bury. From roughly 1790BR onward, crude fortresses and sand-bound camps were first established along the coastal edge of the Broken Strait and the inland canyon routes which were maintained by imperial wardens as well as independent groups of slavers responsible for tracking escapees through the desert and bringing them back. 


##### Economy and Currency
Despite the staggering rate of poverty in Drak’Thill, though Drak’Thill’s merchants trade in the same gold-standard as everywhere else, most of the actual population of Drak’Thill use francs in everyday trading. 

The port cities of Dandebar and One of Drak’Thill’s primary exports is silk, harvested from the larvae of silkwyrms.   
##### Culture and Society 
Given not only the climate but also the lack of any centralised government or formalised laws outside of the rules and dictates of the paschas, daily life in Drak’Thill has always been a fight for survival. Its citizens, often born into impoverished families, live very frugal lives due to the immense disparity in wealth between the common folk and the paschas; gentrified merchants and ganglords.    

The crime rate in Drak’Thill is significantly higher than anywhere else in the world as a direct consequence of this inequality; in a land where might makes right, the ultimate path to earning anything is to take it from someone else. Violence is a common aspect of daily life in Drak’Thill, as its people must navigate a world where personal security is tenuous, and justice is arbitrary, often depending on the whims of their nearest Pascha; the monopolisation of economic resources by these crime syndicates likewise regularly forces many into illegal and often dangerous work, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and dependency. Living in isolated cities with limited access to fresh water and other natural resources compounds these hardships, as the scarcity of essential resources leads to frequent conflicts and makes self-sufficiency a constant struggle for the average Drak'Thillian peasant. 
##### Geography and Landmarks 
Drak’Thill encompasses the entire northern region of Sah’Raza; it is an expansive, sunbaked territory defined by its stone ridges, parched lowlands, and sprawling heat-swept basins. The climate is dry and scorching, marked by predictable seasons of drought and rare, but torrential inland rain that feed subterranean aquifers and deep-cut wadis.

##### Settlements & Structures
While there is no centralised authority in Drak'Thill, the capital city has always largely been considered to be Dandebar; it was the first city to be settled in the Age of Mists by the famed Khagan Drago Yilmaz and later nicknamed “The Emerald City'' by merchants who commonly visited the city to trade some of its many fineries. 

Saladaar’s Garden was a grand monument to hedonism and debauchery constructed with the help of very powerful magic and an exorbitant amount of gold believed to have been raided from Draymond payloads. 
##### Military and Naval Power 
The Bladedancers were a private military outfit which served as the Triarchy’s peacekeeping force in Dandebar for nearly three centuries. To join their ranks was to endure a rigorous selection process and commitment to a lifetime of service.

## The Ancient Isles
Believed to have been home to the first settlers of Valanar some time into the Age of Mists, the Ancient Isles consists of five independent nations. 
### Nydessa
##### Population and Demographics 
Though predominantly inhabited by Humans, Nydessa is something of a melting pot for various demographics. 

Nydessa also boasts a significant Dwarrow population who settled in the Age of Ascension within the underground city of Kraghammer following the Khard Civil War.

The native inhabitants of the lands were tribes of Orcs who lived in relative harmony with one another; many of their ancestors still reside in remnants within the Thornwood Forest, as vestiges of the five major Orc tribes that originally ruled the land.   

There also exists a significant population of Enadriel, who fled to Nydessa following the War of the Elves. It wasn’t until 162SR that King Brandon Steel struck an accord with King Haydn Duskryn which allowed the Enadriel to return to the surface. For many centuries prior, the Enadriel resided in the Worldcaves beneath the Ancient Isles, living in exile as a hidden enemy to the surface kingdoms under the doctrines of the Serpent Queen, Nashandra Vermilithis. 
##### History and Founding
Prior to The Conquering in 145BV, Nydessa was inhabited primarily by Orc clans who were once native to Wodin before being displaced by the Imperator Dragon, Gargryth. These clans, though not particularly powerful, held onto their territories with an iron grip; showing universal hostility to any and all who entered their lands unbidden, likely as a result of their ancestral position as slaves under Gargryth. 

When the Enadriel were exiled from The Fane following the Elven Civil War and landed in Nydessa after weeks of travel, the Orc clans, disparate and isolated as they were, unanimously hunted and killed as many as they could wherever they were encountered: their camps were razed, convoys would be ambushed, and wherever the Enadriel attempted to find a place to settle, they inevitably found more clans of Orcs waiting for them. Thus, the Enadriel were driven underground and forced into an untenable situation, giving rise to what would eventually become present day Tae'eel, but not before centuries more conflict between the new masters of the Worldcaves and their surface dwelling nemeses would elapse.  
###### The Conquering
The Conquering of Nydessa was the titular campaign in which Brandon Steel (dubbed ‘the Conqueror’) unified the fractured lands of [Nydessa](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/10-tv6sPJ3LbTMwtBcCvUxehX7RLO5mR4L9qv71Y2YyY/edit) under the Ironwood Throne. Originally a mercenary under the [Black Empire](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1lapwsR_Nyt49hpFqiALGCObyN28auooyI9KNHr49Jf4/edit), Brandon and his men were dispatched to the untamed shores of Nydessa with the mission to capture its lands for the ever expanding Empire.

Before the Conquering, the land was a chaotic patchwork of Orc clans, each ruling over their territories with fierce independence. Brandon and his fellow mercenaries arrived on these shores under orders from the Black Empire in the year 142SR, intending to annex the land for the Empire's expanding territories. The Empire enacted a two pronged strike, simultaneously beginning their conquering of Nydessa and Caldwynn in a major expansion effort; two years into the wars, The Northern Concordat is signed between Vitgaard, Venizia, Nauska and Brutayne. Caldwynn joins the accord shortly afterwards as each country declares war on Draymond, the heart of the Black Empire. With the eruption of a great war on the Empire's northern front, resources and reinforcements were redirected, leaving Brandon and his forces isolated and without support.

Not wishing to die for nought, Brandon rallied the remaining soldiers and generals around him. Faced with five prominent native Orc clans who dominated the region, Brandon launched a relentless campaign to subdue them. Through strategic battles and decisive leadership, he systematically dismantled the Orc resistance, driving each clan into hiding, or destruction, within their respective forests. Brandon's conquest was characterised by a series of crucial engagements that showcased his military prowess and tactical ingenuity. 

In the power vacuum that followed, Brandon saw a chance to carve out a new destiny. Recognising the fractured state of Nydessa, he began to unite the disparate soldiers and mercenaries left behind. Through charisma and the promise of a unified, prosperous land, he gained the loyalty of key military leaders and seasoned warriors. Brandon's natural leadership and combat prowess quickly earned him the respect of his fellow soldiers. As the highest-ranking officers were either killed or deserted, the remaining mercenaries rallied behind Brandon, recognizing his strategic acumen and unwavering resolve as their best chance for survival and success. This newly forged alliance was not just a coalition of convenience but a determined force ready to reshape the future of Nydessa.

Brandon lead a mercenary cohort consisting of two major companies, Dawn Company and The Red Skippers. Brandon originally held the position of lieutenant within the Dawn Company, watching over a group of 21 soldiers. Brandon became the group’s commander after their previous leader, Sir Jasper Monteau, fled Nydessa on a trade galleon.

Dawn Company was a pivotal force in Brandon Steel's conquest of Nydessa, supplying the bulk of the manpower and providing two-thirds of the mercenaries present. Originating from Draymond, Dawn Company earned a formidable reputation for its ability to "turn beasts into warriors." This elite mercenary group maintained close ties with the monarchy in Draymond, recruiting its members from across Valanar and honing them into elite fighters. 

The company's renown attracted individuals of notable skill and ambition, making it a melting pot of talent and potential. It was within Dawn Company that Brandon forged some of his most crucial alliances, particularly with Houses Hawthorne and Goldtyde. These alliances were built on mutual respect and shared goals, as commanders from these houses held significant positions within the company. Brandon’s rise to command within Dawn Company began under dire circumstances. Following the abrupt desertion of Commander Monteau, the company found itself leaderless and vulnerable. Brandon, then a lieutenant, quickly stepped up, rallying the demoralised soldiers. His first act as commander was to secure their loyalty by promising not only survival but also a new future carved out from the wild lands of Nydessa.

In battles against the native Orc clans, Dawn Company’s discipline and training proved invaluable. Their ability to adapt to the harsh, unpredictable terrain of Nydessa and to employ a mix of guerrilla tactics and traditional warfare allowed them to consistently keep pace with their foes. The commanders of Houses Hawthorne and Goldtyde, Lords William Hawthorne and Gregor Goldtyde, were instrumental in these early victories. Hawthorne, known for his strategic genius, often served as Brandon’s second-in-command, leading flanking manoeuvres that turned the tide in several key skirmishes. Goldtyde, a master of logistics, ensured that the army was always well-supplied, even in the most remote regions of Nydessa.
##### Economy and Currency
Nydessan economics mirrors that of Draymond's in several capacities, especially when it comes to its treatment of the merchant class and how the nation conducts trade on the world stage; the Black Empire has always been an economic powerhouse which has leveraged every export they have ever had access to for maximum control over foreign markets, and the economy of Nydessa likewise thrives on its mastery of the seas and its rich natural resources. 

The currency, Krowns, supports a market heavily influenced by the trade of ironwood, a resource coveted for its durability and flame-retardant properties, ideal for constructing cities and ships alike. The Break Iron Mines, enriched with minerals like iron and mithril, further bolster Nydessa's economy.
##### Culture and Society 

##### Geography and Landmarks 
Nydessa's geography is as varied as its history. From the treacherous Snag, a rocky valley filled with shipwrecks, to the lush, impenetrable Thornwood Forest, which provides sanctuary to the remaining Orcs. The Firewoods, known for their dry, flammable trees and unique flora and fauna, contrast sharply with the fertile, yet blood-soaked Bogwood, scene of the kingdom's bloodiest battles.
- The Break Iron Mines and The Overgrowth: Rich in minerals and surrounded by hazardous thickets, home to untold creatures.
- Drahk Cove: A hub of trade and history, once central to Orcish culture.
- The Marsh and The Bogwood: Ecologically diverse regions critical to Nydessa's commerce and history.
- The King’s Woods: Sacred grounds reserved for royal coronations, embodying Nydessa's conquest and legacy.
- Whaler’s Bay
##### Settlements & Structures
Nydessa is divided into four separate constituencies; the Iron Banner, Emberloft, the Mire Plains and The Overgrowth. 
###### **Iron Banner**
**Ironrath**
The second-largest city in the country, historically accounting for over a third of Nydessa’s military force. Home to the **Iron Banner**, the city is a fortress in its own right, producing elite soldiers and siege weaponry. Founded by Lord William Hawthorne, it remains a stronghold of martial tradition.

**Lonsadille**
A rugged trade town serving as a waypoint for timber and trade moving between Ironrath and Greenacres.

**Oakcrest**
A lumber town supplying shipbuilding materials and fortifications. The surrounding Ironwood forests are dense, leading to frequent conflicts with poachers and outlaws who use the woods for cover.

**Jarvan**
A mining town built into rocky hills, primarily extracting iron and coal. The town is bleak and utilitarian, with little in the way of comfort, and mine collapses are not uncommon. Many of its founding families were former soldiers who took up mining as a final profession after years of service.

**Pinedale**
Known for its production of bows and arrows, Pinedale is vital to Nydessa’s archery corps. It has a strong hunting culture, and many of its youth enter military service as scouts and rangers.

**Greenacres**
A major city and key supply hub for Ironrath. Its storehouses and grain silos fuel Nydessa’s war efforts, though the region is prone to flooding, requiring constant upkeep of levees and embankments.

**Mariana**
A small hamlet built on the southern coastline of Drakh Cove. 
###### **Emberloft**
**Redport** 
The nation's trading capital and the third-largest city. Its deep harbor allows for large-scale international trade, making it a melting pot of cultures and a den of intrigue. Smugglers, merchants, and privateers thrive here.

**Anvil** 
A small but prosperous town, known for its blacksmithing and fine metalwork. Many of Nydessa’s best weapons and armor originate here.

**Troutberk**
A fishing village that supplies much of the coastal population with fresh and salted fish.

**Holmfirth**
A picturesque town known for its vineyards and wine production, though prone to wildfires due to its dry summers.
###### **East Fold**
**Hardale Hall**
The capital city of Nydessa and its oldest human settlement. Built near **Moon Lake**, it serves as the royal seat and the heart of Nydessan governance. Construction of the city was initially ordered by the Black Empire and completed in 144BV, the penultimate year of the Conquering. 

**Kraghammer**
An underground city symbolising Dwarven resilience and craftsmanship constructed in the subterranean caverns beneath Hardale Hall after a large population of Dwarrow refugees from Khard fled the country during its first civil war. Known for its deep mines and legendary forges, it operates with relative autonomy but remains crucial to Nydessa’s economy.

**Kilmarnack**
A rural town known for its horse breeding, providing warhorses to Nydessa’s cavalry.

**Drumchapel**
A prosperous central trade town with roads to Anvil, Holmfirth, Stonereach and Kilmarnack. Considered a vital chokepoint for the East Fold. 

**Stonereach**
The closest city to the Thornwood Forest and perhaps the country's second most well defended settlement.

**Aramore**
A very affluent town in one of the country's most picturesque locations. Some of the world's most eloquent manors and private estates were constructed at the request of the country's nobility here, including Brandon the Conqueror. While politically influential, it is economically reliant on wealthier cities, mainly Stonereach and Hardale Hall, for trade and resources.

###### **Mire-Plains**
**Beckinsdale**

**Clydesdale**
Clydesdale is one of the larger towns of the Mire-Plains, known for its extensive farmland and livestock markets. The surrounding plains make it ideal for large-scale farming and horse breeding. Most of the town is spread out rather than concentrated, with farmsteads and hamlets dotting the surrounding fields.

**Garigill**
The largest town in the **Mire-Plains**, acting as a trade and administrative center. Its wealth comes from controlling trade between Clydesdale and Stormheim and its markets are among the busiest in the region. 

**Mirstone**
A small village, relatively unremarkable except for its proximity to key trade routes and Stormheim  at the fringes of the Mire-Plains, its name derived from the ever-present mist that lingers over the nearby bogs. The people here live simple, isolated lives, relying on subsistence farming, fishing, and peat harvesting.

**Stormheim**
A large city built along the source of the largest of the six 'finger' lakes. 

**New Hardale**
New Hardale is home to Nydessa’s largest prison, a fortress-like structure that dominates the otherwise small settlement. The town exists to serve the prison, with many of its residents being guards, blacksmiths, and clerks who maintain its operation. The prison itself houses Nydessa’s most dangerous criminals, from high-profile traitors to violent offenders unfit for normal incarceration.
###### **The Overgrowth**
**Shirebrook**
A town 

**Gardale**

**Jostle**

**Synthia**
##### Military and Naval Power 
Much of the Nydessan military’s modus operandi originates from the Draymond Empire; as a direct result of their influence in the conquering of Nydessa (or perhaps lack thereof) the invading Humans slowly adopted guerrilla tactics 

The Iron Banner, Nydessa's military branch, benefits massively from its access to ironwood; not only are their shields anti-flammable, their siege equipment and fortifications are likewise next to impossible to destroy. 

The construction of indomitable warships made almost exclusively from ironwood positions Nydessa as a formidable naval power, a legacy rooted in its history as excellent seafarers; many history’s most notable admirals and generals have been Nydessan stock. This advantage on the seas, combined with its geographical location and strong military tradition, ensures Nydessa's continued dominance and influence in the region.

### Agrassilla’Kunthropia
Officially founded in 150BV, its history dates back to at least 145BV with the presence of Dragonborn. 
##### Population and Demographics  
Predominantly inhabited by Dragonborn, Agrassilla’Kunthropia consists of both metallic and chromatic Dragonborn. However, Humans were known to have migrated from Wodin after the Unification War. 
##### History and Founding 
Initially two separate entities, Agrassilla and Kunthropia were founded on opposite sides of Stedmann’s Divide. The chromatic Dragonborn inhabited Agrassilla, while Kunthropia was home to metallic Dragonborn. A brutal five-year crusade led by Kunthropia against Agrassilla resulted in the unification of the lands under the name Agrassilla’Kunthropia.

In the history of Agrassilla'Kunthropia, the relationship between the metallic and chromatic Draconians is marked by deep-seated racial tensions, ultimately leading to the dominance of the metallic Draconians and the subjugation of their chromatic counterparts. This conflict stems from ideological zealotry and deeply ingrained prejudices, which culminate in a structured hierarchy that places the metallic Draconians in a position of superiority.
##### Economy and Currency  
The currency, known as Imperial krowns (or krimps for short), sustains an economy heavily influenced by its groundbreaking floating cities and extensive mining operations. The Slag Pits and Drunmülf Gorge, the latter notorious for its perilous conditions, are testament to the land's rich mineral resources.

Trade with neighbouring countries has always been critical in order to sustain the magnificent flying cities and their constant consumption of resources. 
##### Culture and Society  
The society of Agrassilla’Kunthropia grapples with deep-seated racial divisions between chromatic and metallic Dragonborn. The ritualistic removal of tails among chromatic Dragonborn at birth underscores the enduring strife and resistance within the populace.

The metallic Draconians, driven by a belief in their own supremacy, systematically marginalised the chromatic Draconians. This resulted in the chromatics being deprived of basic rights, subjected to oppressive policies, and forced into subservient roles. The society of Agrassilla'Kunthropia became sharply divided, with the metallics controlling key aspects of governance, resources, and military power, while the chromatics faced widespread discrimination and exclusion.

The ramifications of this division were profound, affecting every aspect of Draconian society. The once unified cultural and spiritual traditions of the Draconians fractured, leading to a loss of shared identity and heritage. The Chromatics, in their subjugated state, struggled to preserve their customs and beliefs under the oppressive rule of the metallics.
##### Geography and Landmarks
Agrassilla’Kunthropia is a land of contrasts, from the awe-inspiring floating cities, accessible only to metallic Dragonborn and certain authorities, to the haunted Fading Forest, site of the grisly Osthill Massacre. The land's history is etched in every aspect of its society, from its architecture to its customs.

- Floating Cities: Symbols of Dragonborn ingenuity and pride, showcasing advanced magical prowess.
- Greywharf: The guardian of Stedmann’s Divide, controlling access to the vital river.
- Riikzahn’s Landing: A historic cliffside, marking the conqueror Riikzahn’s arrival and now a training ground for Wyvern-riding Dragonborn Hussars.
- Stedmann’s Divide: A significant geographical and historical marker, delineating Old Agrassilla from Old Kunthropia.
- The Stormshores: A turbulent coastal region believed to be cursed by Bahamut as retribution for the invasion of Agrassilla.
- The Fingers: A network of streams creating natural sanctuaries, untouched by civilization.
- Ivory Crag and Tempest Bluffs: Mountainous areas rich in history and natural danger.
- Baator’s Quarries: Renowned for their geothermal activity, offering tourist attractions like hot springs and geysers.
##### Settlements & Structures
Agrassilla’Kunthropia is renowned for its magical advancements, particularly in sustaining objects in flight, as seen in their floating cities and sky ships. This technological prowess extends to their military capabilities, with Greywharf acting as a strategic naval checkpoint.
##### Military and Naval Power  
For almost a millenia, the Draconian Empire boasted perhaps the most powerful military force in all of Valanar. Not only did they enforce conscription for all able bodied Chromatics for a minimum service term of five years, they

### Iprosea
##### Population and Demographics 
Iprosea is a melting pot of races and cultures, primarily consisting of refugees, exiles, and adventurers who fled turmoil in their homelands. Iprosea’s demographics are incredibly diverse, with little regard for racial hierarchies or nobility; survival and skill determine one’s place in society.
##### History and Founding
While small tribes of Humans were known to have occupied the island territories from as early as 300BR, it wasn’t until 151SR that the nation would be considered a sovereign kingdom on the world stage. 
##### Economy and Currency
Iprosean society is a complex blend of organised mercantile rule and chaotic self-governance; on the mainland and the larger islands, merchant lords maintain some semblance of order, overseeing trade and ensuring their territories remain stable. However, the true character of Iprosea lies in its vast network of smaller islands and its waters, where laws are often flexible, and authority changes hands regularly.

It comes as no surprise that piracy, privateering, and smuggling are common, and many Iproseans see these activities as necessary for survival. Law enforcement is patchwork at best; on the seas, power lies in the hands of whoever commands the strongest fleet. Merchants often rely on hired mercenaries for protection, particularly when navigating dangerous island channels and dealing with rival factions.

In its prime, Iprosea would become a bustling trading capital, acting as the world’s market for all things; magical, illicit, exotic, the country of Iprosea is all of these things, and all countries enjoy the benefits of its independence, despite the occasional conflict of interest. 
##### Culture and Society 
Although the mainland is generally safer than the seas and enjoys some formalised laws, the merchant lords only have a tentative grip on the island territories; in reality, when on the seas one is only beholden to the local authority, if any. Outside of any formalised judicial system, Iprosea’s citizens are largely left to govern themselves. 

Merchants who travel to Iprosea often hire mercenary companies to protect their cargo as well as escorting their ships in and around the island channels.
##### Geography and Landmarks
The Iprosean archipelago is composed of hundreds of islands, ranging from large, fertile territories to small, barren rocks. The islands are connected by narrow, treacherous channels, and the seas around them are notorious for hidden reefs, strong currents, and unpredictable weather. This makes navigation difficult, even for experienced sailors, but also serves as a natural defence against invaders.
##### Settlements & Structures
Bloodstone, the largest settlement on the island of Navalavega, stands as the political and economic heart of Iprosea; its docks are always bustling with activity, accommodating everything from merchant galleons to pirate sloops. 

Seconded only by Cacao in size, Bloodstone was once one of many smaller settlements ruled by gentrified merchant lords before it was liberated by Captain Shira Dyer, who commanded over 5,000 pirates at the height of her power and was famous for pulling off multiple raids on Draymond warships and supply lines. 

Major cities feature a mix of towering stone fortresses, hastily built wooden shacks, and repurposed ships docked permanently as floating markets. The older parts of these cities are walled, with narrow streets leading to large market squares and sprawling shipyards. On smaller islands, settlements are often simple and built from local resources—driftwood huts, canvas tents, or even hollowed-out caverns used as homes and warehouses. Wealthier merchant lords and pirates often build lavish mansions perched on cliffs overlooking the sea, secured against attack by private militias and ringed with hidden watchtowers.
##### Military and Naval Power  
Despite a lack of any centralised government or standing army, Iprosea is still widely considered to possess one of the most fearsome marine forces in the world; self-serving sea rogues they may be, but when organised, these corsairs are unrivalled in naval warfare. Iprosean captains are known for their mastery of the region’s treacherous waters, making them difficult to outmanoeuvre or ambush.

The most powerful pirate captains often employ their own private forces, equipped with fast, heavily armed vessels capable of both trade escort and naval warfare. In times of external threat, rival factions in Iprosea can rally together, forming a loose coalition to defend the archipelago, though internal conflict is not uncommon even during such alliances.

## The Worldcaves
Also known colloquially as the 'underdark', the Worldcaves are an expansive network of tunnels and caverns which houses an entirely unique ecology and ecosystem. Many species call the Worldcaves their home, though few of them are what other races would consider 'civilised.' 

Worldcave politics are vastly unlike the

## The Elder Gods
Little is known about the Elder Gods. They are the supposed creators of the Titans, and the cosmos as a whole, though little to no evidence of their existence exists or has ever been found. 

The primary theory is that the Elder Gods were born out of the void's desire 
## The Titans
The Titans are the scions of balance and life, created by the Elder Gods to bear the flame of creation. These nine beings are believed to have once walked the planes in mortal form, before conceiving the High Pantheon and ultimately departing from the physical world for good. Their respective Pillars of Creation are the only evidence humanity has of their existence. 
### Malkis
Nicknames - Death, The Master of Chaos, The First Heretic, The Tidebringer
Portfolio - Death, Murder, Evil, Chaos, Chance, Fear, Souls
Domain - Death
Pillar - Horn of Malkis; a gnarled black horn 4 inches long - implanted to the skull of its wielder, the horn allows the user to harness the souls of the dead and send them to their resting places. The horn can send the souls into other bodies, empowering that body or instilling the soul with new life. The horn is said to send its wielder mad.

Malkis was the patriarch of the Titans, the Father of the Gods, and the figure from whom much of the cosmic order descended. Unlike the later portrayals of him as a figure of pure evil, Malkis was the shepherd of death, ensuring the natural transition of souls and the cyclical balance of the cosmos. He did not revel in chaos for its own sake but understood that death and disorder were necessary components of creation’s grand design. The Horn of Malkis allowed him to guide souls through the planes as the custodian of their final journeys. His connection to chaos was not malevolent but a reflection of the unpredictable forces of fate and chance.

Malkis’ most significant legacy was the creation of the cycle of life and death. He stood at the cusp of creation and dissolution, maintaining a cosmic order that no other being could. His union with Paletress birthed the Higher Pantheon, and though Malkis was a figure feared by many, he was also revered as the Father of the Gods. It was his guidance that led to the creation of the first souls, and his power over the forces of death ensured that the natural order endured throughout the aeons. The balance between life and death, creation and destruction, was a sacred bond that Malkis maintained, long before the gods arose to claim their dominions.
### Du’Vall
Nicknames - The Defiler, The Archmage
Portfolio - Magic, Intelligence, Evocation, Revolution
Domain - Magic
Pillars - Sceptre of the Defiler; a five foot staff made of pure mithril, on each end three gemstones orbit the tips - the sceptre imbues the wielder with the power to cast spells long forgotten, as well as with the power to sense any and all magic in the world.

Du'Vall was the first master of magic, shaping the raw arcane forces of the cosmos into the systems that the world still uses today. His Sceptre of the Defiler was not merely a tool of power but a cosmic key that allowed Du'Vall to manipulate the weave of reality itself. Where the other Titans worked to shape the physical elements of the world, Du'Vall wove the unseen forces of magic into existence, making possible the art of spellcasting, enchantment, and the manipulation of reality. His intelligence and arcane mastery were so far beyond the comprehension of mortals that entire schools of magic are said to have been inspired by just glimpses of his experiments. Though later mortals would speak of magic as something they could study and control, Du'Vall was its ultimate creator, having defined and shaped the very arcane laws that govern reality.
### Samson
Nicknames - The Mason, The Stoneweaver, The Bronze
Portfolio - Earth, Stone, Minerals, Manufacture, Lava
Domain - Earth
Pillar - Tidestone Gauntlets; a pair of large bronze gauntlets with runes all across it which pulse softly with energy - the gauntlets meld to the wielder’s body, making their skin turn a deep bronze colour and their hair fall out, they give the wielder the power to move earth and stone to their will, as well as giving them the ability to create raw minerals. 

Samson was the Titan of Earth, shaping the very bones of the Material Plane. His power over stone, minerals, and lava allowed him to create the mountain ranges, valleys, and caverns that would form the foundation of the world. With his Tidestone Gauntlets, Samson could raise entire continents from the depths of the oceans, carve great mountain ranges, and mould lava flows into solid stone with a mere gesture.
### Dalatrass
Nicknames -  The First God, The Bringer of Rain 
Portfolio - Water, Animals, Weather
Domain - Water
Pillar - Darkshore Trident; a five foot jewel encrusted brass trident, it is freezing to the touch, but once wielded becomes comfortable in the wielder’s grip. The wielder grows gills, and gains the ability to breathe underwater, as well as speak to any animals that live there. The trident holds the power to manipulating any and all liquids.

Dalatrass was the most fluid and adaptable of the Titans, ruling over the oceans, rivers, and weather. Often referred to as The First God, Dalatrass shaped the oceans and seas of the Material Plane, filling them with life. His role was to ensure that the world’s weather patterns were balanced, that the rains brought fertility and that the seas remained tame. Dalatrass was a peaceful being, content to watch over the creatures of the sea. However, his gentle nature was often seen as a weakness by the other Titans, and he remained a neutral observer even as chaos began to creep into their ranks.
### Paletress
Nicknames - The Mother, The Confessor, The High Priest, The Absolute
Portfolio - Life, Creation, Growth, Evolution
Domain - Life
Pillar - Verdant Oath; a three foot long heavy rod emblazoned with ageless emblems, it has a skull sprouting wings resting on the top, made entirely of gold. The wielder of this rod gains very pale skin, as well as pupil-less eyes - they also gain the ability to grant any being a soul (and thus life). They can also detect any life, choosing to make it more powerful or healthy.
### King Reeve
Nicknames - The Storm King, King of the Titans
Portfolio - Wind, Lightning, Rain, Weather, Cold
Domain - Wind
Pillar - Storm King’s Crown; a rusted golden crown - the crown is so heavy that it embeds itself into the wearer’s head, causing their hair to turn old and grey. It gives the wearer the ability to create hurricanes, tornados, and vicious storms, as well as manipulate gas and wind, as well as lightning. This artefact also grants the wearer flight.
### Upir
Nicknames - The Expunged
Portfolio - Knowledge, Fate, [Expunged]
Domain - Knowledge
Pillar - The Lost Pillar; not much is known about this pillar, apart from the fact that using it grant’s the wielder knowledge of everything that has been, will be, and could be.
### Verdonis
Nicknames - The Willow, The Wise, The Dutiful
Portfolio - Nature, Animals
Domain - Nature
Pillar - Horn of the Willow; a large white horn with ancient carvings lining its side which if paid close attention to, tells a story - The horn is only usable by its master, who is the last person to have blown the horn. In order for the horn to obtain new ownership, its previous master must be killed. This artefact grants its master control over all nature. This includes the manipulation of trees, grass, and all other natural terrain. The horn also allows a strong bond and communication with animals, as well as control and summoning of any and all natural animals.
### Zelius
Nicknames - Father of Time, The Father, The Fated One, The Eternal
Portfolio - Time, Fate, Facts, Science, Patience
Domain - Time
Pillar - Zelius’ Hourglass; a large pendant of thin silver lace, carrying a glass hourglass filled with sand. No matter how long the hourglass is left, the sand never completely runs out - this pendant freezes the wielder’s ageing process. The wielder of the pendant can move through time at will. The pendant prevents the wielder from dying by ageing. 

## The High Pantheon
The direct descendants of the Titans, the High Pantheon are the creators and shepherds of all sentient life. They each reside in their respective realms of thought, existing metaphysically as constellations in the night sky. 
### Bælthatrax
Nicknames - The Archon
Alignment - Lawful Good
Portfolio - Dragons, Wind, Dragonborn
Domains - Air, Dragon, Good, Luck, Nobility, Patience, Storms

A relatively minor cult of fanatics who follow the Sisters, a coven of extraordinarily powerful witches who corrupted the Waking Wood, which is the mythological birthplace of the Serende’hel themselves. Despite their sacrilegious acts and complete desecration of the holy land, the Sisters are worshipped by some as the caretakers - or perhaps protectors - of the Ende’hel’s ancestral homeland.

Focus: Protecting the Waking Wood, by any means necessary.  
Purpose: To spread the truth of the Sisters of the Waking Wood and expand their domain of influence.  
Distinct Practices: A ritual involving sacrificial bloodletting and the ritualistic painting of a bleeding eye onto the bark of tree trunks and rock faces, believed to be intended as a way to grant the Sisters influence over the forests and feed their lifeforce with the psionic energy they need to keep the Waking Wood as their domain - and their domain alone.  
Differences in Worship: Through their acts of worship, the followers of the Sisters are branded as heretics due to their application of blood magic and blasphemous rhetoric. 
##### Order of the Silver Hand
The Silver Hand were an order of proud and zealous paladins who vehemently detested the lesser races, with their cousins the Enadriel being numbered among the lesser races. For many years, members of the Silver Hand used the Worldcaves as hunting grounds, kidnapping and killing Enadriel.

The Silver Hand’s ultimate goal was to cleanse the world of the lesser races, particularly the Enadriel, through what they believed to be a holy crusade. They sought to purify the world and restore what they considered to be the natural hierarchy, with their race standing at the top. In their view, this "divine order" was necessary for maintaining balance and preventing chaos from spreading.

Tairon is a very common name. Many believe the origins of the name to rest with Lord Tairon Silverbark himself, however this is not the case - they lie instead with the ruins of the birthplace of the Serende’hel, the City of Tairon, which Silverbark himself was named after. Though the city is now merely a place of myth along with the majority of Morrowsea, the exploits of Seradriel were believed to have been first chronicled there.

### Shōdahn
Nicknames - The Many Faced God
Alignment - Chaotic Evil
Portfolio - Change, Chaos, Pain
Weapon - [Glaive, ‘Malice’](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aDq5CIJTOxbrWcjZw-njN9MWwD_INRTdjOPS1hE-XQ0/edit)
Domains - Chaos, Evil, Madness, Trickery, War, Wrath
Symbol - Monstrous Face
Prayer - “Puppeteer of chaos and director of woe, the time of change is always at hand, and I come to you in search of divine guidance. Point me in the right direction and I will march.”

While the worship of Shōdahn has never been particularly popular, Her followers are known to exist in most nations. The teachings Her followers espouse consist of stoicism and courage in the face of unrelenting chaos and evil. Only the strong will survive in Shōdahn’s domain. 
##### Worship Practices
They often subject themselves to ritualistic self-mutilation or extreme trials of endurance to gain their god’s favour. To endure suffering without complaint is seen as a sign of strength, while those who flee from it are considered weak. Some cults of Shodahn practice ceremonial beatings, scarification, or exposure to extreme elements as rites of passage. 

##### Rituals & Ceremonies
Followers of Shodahn engage in rituals that symbolise renewal and transformation, often through destruction. Burning old icons, destroying relics, or ritualistically tearing down structures (literal or metaphorical) is seen as an offering to Shodahn. In some cults, followers undergo physical transformations, such as scarring or body modifications, to show their willingness to evolve. They often subject themselves to ritualistic self-mutilation or extreme trials of endurance to gain their god’s favour; To endure suffering without complaint is seen as a sign of strength, while those who flee from it are considered weak. Likewise, other cults of Shodahn practice ceremonial beatings, scarification, or exposure to extreme elements as rites of passage. 

##### Teachings and Doctrines
​​To Shodahn’s followers, suffering is the source of strength. Pain, both physical and emotional, is a gift from Shodahn. It tempers the body and spirit, making the individual stronger. To survive pain is to prove one’s worth, and to inflict it is to show dominance.

##### Common Folk
Shōdahn’s worship does not have a heavy presence among the common people, as her followers are often part of secret societies or warbands that thrive on conflict. However, in times of great suffering or upheaval, rumours of Shōdahn’s cults emerge, feeding on the fears and desperation of the downtrodden.

It is common among the superstitious to whisper about the “Faces of Chaos,” attributing any sudden misfortunes, plagues, or devastating wars to Shōdahn's unseen hand. It is said that those who embrace her teachings in such times may rise from the ashes stronger, but they do so at the cost of their humanity.

### Nox 
Nicknames - The Dweller on the Horizon
Alignment - Lawful Neutral
Portfolio - Roads, Travel, Distance
Weapon - Quarterstaff, ‘Traveller's Aide’
Domains - Balance, Celerity, Generosity, Luck, Portal, Protection, Travel, Weather
Symbol - Disk w/ a Horizon Line & Sliver of Moon over it
Prayer - “To Nox, watcher of mile and wind. While I do not yet know every path, I ask that you guide my steps, so that I may never step foot on ill-tread roads.”
##### Worship Practices
Nox is known to have many waystones across well travelled paths and roads, believed to have been erected all across the world as early as the Age of Mists by his most devout clerics. Travelers stop at these waystones to offer coins, flowers, or even words of gratitude for protection, hoping for Nox’s watchful eyes to guide them; while Nox is not known for requiring grand temples or intricate rituals, his presence is felt in these simple acts of prayer and offering performed along roadsides, at waystones, before journeys begin and right as they end. 
##### Rituals & Ceremonies
The rituals of Nox’s followers are often private, practiced by individuals or small groups. Rituals focus on the act of travel itself, offering Nox their intentions before embarking on any significant journey. Pilgrims and travelling merchants alike will stop at the first available waystone or shrine of Nox to recite his prayer, asking for favourable weather, clear paths, and protection from thieves and dangers on the road.

In the many churches where an altar of Nox is present, priests maintain meditation ceremonies that guide the spirits of those lost or travelling through the spiritual realm. The offerings made here are often maps, shoes, or tools of the traveller, symbolising the journey they have yet to complete.
##### Teachings and Doctrines
The journey, not the destination, is what holds the most value. To walk a road, whether well-worn or untraveled, is to experience the world as Nox intended. His followers are taught to respect all roads and paths, never to block or sabotage them, for that would be disrupting the natural order of travel.

- Generosity – On the road, everyone is a fellow traveller. Help those in need along the way, for one day, you may need their help in return.
- Adaptability – No path remains constant forever. Travellers must be able to adapt to changing conditions, be it weather, fortune, or personal obstacles.
- Endurance – The road will often be long and hard. Followers of Nox must endure its challenges without complaint. To stop or give up is to dishonour the journey itself.
- Preparedness – While the future is unknown, those who follow Nox prepare for all possibilities through forethought, careful planning, and the gathering of resources—both material and spiritual.

#### Influence on Society
##### Mages and Scholars
Scholars of Nox are often skilled cartographers or astronomers, deeply involved in mapping the world, studying the stars, and ensuring that the paths of the world remain connected. They also play a key role in studying portals and gateways, believing that Nox oversees not only physical roads but also the metaphysical pathways between realms.
##### Common Folk
For most, Nox is a household name; the everyday impact of his worship is seen in the small shrines found at crossroads and waystones as common folk leave behind tokens of gratitude—a copper coin, a scrap of fabric, or even food for animals—as offerings to Nox.

The culture surrounding Nox places a great deal of emphasis on hospitality and generosity. It is a common practice in many cultures to offer shelter and food to travellers; to deny them would be to deny Nox himself. 
##### Political Influence
As far as political disputes are concerned the followers of Nox often find service as advisors and mediators, helping governments and local rulers maintain their infrastructure and ensuring that roads and trade routes remain open. Their neutrality makes them trusted negotiators in disputes between kingdoms, often helping to resolve territorial conflicts over road access or trade.

Their knowledge of weather patterns and safe routes makes them invaluable to governments reliant on trade and movement. Noxians act as mediators in conflicts, particularly those that affect travel or commerce. They seek to maintain peaceful passage and balance between factions, always striving to avoid disruptions to the flow of trade and diplomacy.
##### Art and Literature
It comes as no surprise that Nox has been attributed by many of history’s greatest writers and most accomplished cartographers for blessing them on their journeys as they sought to document the geography of the world.

## The Lower Pantheon

Lower Pantheon deities are classified by their ascension from mortality to deific status through one way or another; the most commonly held belief is that mortals with extreme or otherwise widely held influence eventually become worshipped as idols of a particular nature, either while they are alive or posthumously. It is believed that their influence in the Astral Ocean becomes strong enough to anchor their presence there as a result of this worship.

### Vergil
Nicknames - The Outsider, The Wanderer
Alignment - Chaotic Neutral
Portfolio - Bargains, Guidance, Vengeance, Independence
Weapon - Stiletto, ‘Last Wish’ 
Domains - Knowledge, Power, Volition, Caprice
Symbol - A Vertical Coin
Prayer - N/A   

Otherwise known as “The Wanderer”, Vergil was presumably once a mortal based on accounts of those who have claimed to meet him, appearing as different things to different people, often as a humanoid, but also as a multitude of things; sometimes not at all, simply appearing as a voice or a force. Always, the accounts of his appearance include the gift of divine clarity of purpose, where those he appears to come away with the means and the will to carry out their goal, whatever that may be. Due to this, a number of crimes are sometimes attributed to Vergil’s influence, from something as calculated as the assassination of a King to a momentary act of extreme violence.  

Vergil has been idolised more as a mythical character than a deity, and as such, has no formalised religious following, and unlike most other Gods, nobody can concretely say that he even exists. Not only does he not have a constellation (that we have yet been able to observe, at least), but the accounts from those who claim to have communed with him have all been conflicting at the very best. While some claim to have been offered great power in their time of need, others claim to have entered into bargains or otherwise negotiated for their gift, or forced upon them against their will. 

Debates over the authenticity of these accounts have raged in academic circles for generations. Many sceptics argue that Vergil is merely a personification of one's inner desires and ambitions; a psychological manifestation rather than a deity. The more superstitiously inclined believe that Vergil is a trickster god, toying with mortals for his own amusement. The most popular canonisations of Vergil come from scholastic interpretations of tomes unearthed in the Age of Mists; the contents of these documents vary in precise detail, and are written by a multitude of authors.

The Prince of Fire holds a unique place in Valanar’s lower pantheon; worshipped almost exclusively by the Dwarrow of Eastern Rakia, Azamuth’s worship is virtually transactional in nature. He is believed to be an entity of the Elemental Plane of Fire, one of the very few beings of such planes to be granted congruent thought. 

His followers believe he can be seen by staring deeply into a fire, and subsequently depict him as a sentient flame. 

In the aftermath of Zephyra’s eruption, the Forgelords were desperate to quarantine any seismic activity from affecting their beloved Mt. Rakia. Thus, they pleaded with Azamuth to quell the volcano’s bubbling core.

Creator of the Death Wind style of martial arts. Believed to have been born in Drak’Thill, Daav was a legendary figure and veritable bogeyman to any who considered themselves to be a warrior. Known far and wide as the Demon King after a legendary battle with a fel creature. For many years he wandered the lands in search of one who could challenge him - none could withstand his blows, nor could they survive his bloodlust. Any who dared test themselves against him were found wanting, if not completely obliterated. 

He fought unarmed, and was said to possess inhuman reflexes and agility to match his otherworldly strength. His style of martial arts, the Death Wind, is believed to have been only passed down to a single disciple per generation of student before eventually spreading out to the wider world.

## The Primordial Dragons

### The Sacrifice of the Immortals
In a time before the fledgling races of Valanar took their first steps, the six Primordial Dragons, each of them gifted with unique traits by their God, Bælthatrax, were the first sentient beings to grace the material plane.

Initially, the Primordial Dragons were created by the Gods to ensure that the boundaries between the planes were maintained; in the event that beings from other planes found their way to the prime material plane of Valanar, the Dragons would rise to meet them. As a result of their role as guardians of Valanar, they were granted an exceptional amount of power, and each of them were given a domain to protect. 

These Primordials acted as immortal guardians, unafflicted by the course of time - as their battles raged on against the nightmarish creatures which spawned ever more frequently from the encroaching chaos of the abyss, the Dragons knew that eventually their strength would wain and they would one day falter in their task just enough for chaos to corrupt the impeccable balance the material plane had been created with. Though immortal, the Primordials came to understand a grim truth: the passage of time did not erode them, but it did not strengthen them either. The horrors they faced evolved, while they remained unchanged. It was this understanding that led to their first and greatest sacrifice—they petitioned Bælthatrax to relinquish their immortality in exchange for the ability to reproduce. In giving up their eternal nature, they birthed the mortal bloodlines of Dragonkin, ensuring that their legacy could grow, adapt, and multiply across generations. 

This, however, would not be the only sacrifice the Primordials made on behalf of their Gods. In a day long forgotten to time and history, the sun was blotted out from the sky by a hole so black that it mirrored the Abyss itself. As creatures of the outer planes began to crawl out from the heavens, the Primordial Dragons flew into the hole, sealing it behind them as they went, never to be seen again. All of the Dragons who witnessed this act of sacrifice are presumed to have perished, but some still remain, slumbering in some unknown deep chasm, with power and knowledge of things far more ancient than any other creature in the world. 

This tale is passed on through Bælthatrax’s holy tomes, with the ‘Sacrifice of the Immortals’ being a favoured story by some Priests.
##### Borrsundrutherxes, the Mantle of Dawn
The first of the Primordials, he was entrusted with the power of light - his task, to illuminate all places where darkness falls and to flush out the corruption where its roots took hold. His golden scales were often seen glimmering across the skies during the day, unresting in his mission to quell all darkness. When stood on four legs his resting height reached roughly thirty (30) feet, and from head to tail he was roughly ninety (90) feet long.

He was perhaps the people's favourite when it came to the Primordials, his stature as the smallest of the Primordials as well as his willingness to sometimes parley with the people of the land helped him a great deal with his public appearance. He was even known to sometimes spend great times slumbering in fields not too far from civilization, and people would willingly bring him tithes of food or gold for protecting their lands.

Borrsundrutherxes is also well known from a tale in Bælthatrax’s holy book, he is never named directly but is widely believed to be the main focus of the story ‘The Wyrm who Loved’. There are many similarities between the story told in the holy tome and the tales passed down of the relationship between Borrsundrutherxes and the second Princess of Draymond. Both tales go on to explain how the two spent many days together talking in the castle courtyard, and they even speak of the Primordial allowing the Princess to mount and ride him; commoners would spread tales of messages written in the clouds proclaiming their princess’ beauty, and for years their friendship flourished. Rumours arose amongst the common folk that when the Princess took no husband on her eighteenth birthday, she was instead to marry Borrsundrutherxes. Nothing came of this, of course, but the Princess never took a husband for as long as she lived. When the time came where the Princess grew old and weary, the Dragon visited every day - until the bells tolled for death, and a great shadow was cast over the city. 

Borrsundrutherxes never spoke to a Human again after that day, though he did resume his duties as the power of light.
##### Iourmudralferion, the First Lamprey
The second of the Primordials, she was entrusted with the power of the seas - her task, to conquer the sapphire wastes and take them as her own, watching over the planar split at the bottom of the world.

Her scales were that of cobalt and amethyst, her body long and slender. She sported no appendages, taking a form closer to a water serpent. When measured from her base she was roughly twelve (12) feet tall (or wide, depending on how you look at it), and from head to tail she was thought to be just over four hundred (400) feet long.

To the common people of Valanar, she was known as the forebearer mother of Dragons - not only to the many offspring she produced, but to any who graced her seas; notoriously inhospitable to any who went against her will. To many she was a being to be feared, often the topic of many a bedtime story to teach children to not tarry in the seas - but to those in the know (sailors, and the like) she acted an ardent protector of the people, taking up the thankless task of taming the nefarious waters of Valanar.

Any offerings left to her were customarily thrown into the sea, for even if these valuables are lost to all, she would surely find it.

Her presence in the early world was celebrated, up until her betrayal by the hand of her youngest son - Gargryth, the fury. For all of conceived time, she and her children swore to protect the people of Valanar, but this did not last, as the petulant Gargryth’s ear was turned by the Dragon Queen, Tiamat. When Gargryth told his mother of his ambitions to carve out a piece of land for his family, their fallout was legendary, and still felt for ages to come. Gargryth flew into a rage, forcefully taking the land now known as Wodin, in the process.

Iourmudralferion never sired another child, drifting to the lowest depths of the seas, where she hid her shame until the sacrifice of the immortals.
##### Rasmundarthaxus, Ardent Rex 
The third of the Primordials, Rasmundarthaxus was given the responsibility of ensuring the frozen wastes of Valanar remained as such - cold.

His scales were that of ivory, and any who beheld him claimed he emanated morning-dew like frost; voluminous to cover large swathes of land wherever he resided, and with the strength to freeze water.

When stood on four legs his resting height reached 50 (fifty) feet, and from head to tail he was roughly 140 (one hundred and fourty) feet long.

Rasmundarthaxus originally claimed the desolate plains of the forbidden lands, before migrating south to main-land Valanar to resume his duties. In the Age of Mist, a large planar rift tore open to the south of Einartoft, from which demons of the abyss spewed forth. The Ardent Rex harnessed his powers to freeze over a significant portion of the ocean where the rift began, turning its surface to ice so cold and solid that no abyssal could ever break through without being frozen to death. As time passed, the ice eventually thawed and cracked away, leaving behind only glaciers and icebergs, though the memory and legend of his great power remain. The colloquially named ‘frozen ocean’ still hums with magic to this day, standing as a stalwart gate between Valanar and the Abyss.

Rasmundarthaxus’ name inspired thoroughness, being known as the most diligent of the Primordials. He was indifferent to the people of his domains, and known to more commonly prefer the isolated peaks of mountaintops, over areas where he would more likely be disturbed. He chose the highest peak of Valanar, now known as ‘Primordial Valley’, as his main domicile for this very reason. Unlike the other Primordials, he cared not for offerings or gold, and hoarded no treasures; he instead opted to live in forbearance, patiently waiting for his domain to be disrupted so that he may rise to meet the challenge.
##### Nhifogihr’Tharakandrom, the Arbiter of the Gods
The fourth of the primordials, Nhifoghir held one of the most holy duties - to ensure that no single entity in Valanar threatened the delicate balance of power, not even the Gods. His scales were that of iridescent obsidian, thick and chitinous; he was known as the largest of the primordials, and possibly the most revered, his prodigious size alone enough to hush any words of rebellion against the status quo. When stood on four legs, his resting height reached roughly 80 (eighty) feet, and from head to tail he was roughly 180 (one hundred and eighty) feet long.


Huge

Ate demons, loved fighting
Cave crawler, dug through dirt
Worked for long periods then rested equally as long
Believed to be created to rival the gods

Topic of book ‘conversations w/ a dragon’
##### Yom Osiris Neba’al, the Western Sun
A wingless wyrm who was capable of flight but nonetheless resided in the sands of the Dry Sea, creating the entire desert landscape with his movements
Heated sands with friction, slept at night
Kept sands warm with his constant movement, let them cool as he slept

##### Zephyra’Kermes, the Many Tailed
With her nine serpentine tails, Zerphyra’Kermes was known for her size as the second largest Primordial.

Her primary responsibility was using her magnificently sized tails to fan the volcanoes of Khard, hence the name of its largest peak; Mt. Zephyra.

## The Archfiends
Scholars and theologists of the Old Faith suggest that the Archfiends were created as the antithetical Titans. Different sources offer varying depictions of the Archfiends, spanning different continents, cultures and ages. Their origins are mostly entirely unknowable, much like the Gods and the Titans before them; despite this, throughout time and history, their presence has been just as much of a constant. Likewise, little is known about how one communes with these beings.

The Archfiends are typically personified as archetypal beings who embody different aspects of the human condition, however all things are best-guesses when it comes to these beings. One thing is absolutely certain: there are forces at work in the hearts and minds of all men, and long have we tried to find something to blame for our own hubris and evil. 

Several contemporary accounts have been collected and studied over the years which have lead us to believe these Archfiends occupy an almost deific status in the lives of anyone who seeks their audience; some suggest to even know of the Archfiends is to be enslaved to the knowledge of their existence. 

It is theorised that the reason the High Pantheon decided to transcend into the Astral Ocean was to betray the Archfiends and to better steer the hearts of men rather than protect them from the dangers they would come to face, as Kane had chosen to do. If the High Pantheon had not given man the freedom to choose, the Archfiends would have occupied the Astral Ocean entirely, thus enslaving all of humanity to wickedness and evil. 

##### Jhoss Agathon Ab’uul
Nicknames - Agathon, The Black Judge, The Tyrant
Portfolio - Guilt, Hatred, Paranoia, Ego, Pride, Envy
Domain - Wrath
Symbol - Blindfolded Man

A being of pure malice and rage, Agathon accepts nothing but perfection from his subjects. As the Master of the Black Court, Agathon is the void’s judgement of being made manifest. Pride and Wrath are the pillars of his domain, as great men succumb to vanity and weaker men to jealousy - none can escape Agathon’s judgement, and all are found wanting in the face of the vacuous abyss. 
##### Malphagar
Nicknames - Sultan, The Exempt, The Immortal
Portfolio - Nihilism, Dread, Time, Fate, Patience, Immortality, Knowledge
Domain - Time
Symbol - Pyramid, Lamniscate

Considered perhaps as the antithesis to Zelius, Malphagar is believed to hold power over time, being able to move through it at will. The basis for this belief comes from Malphagar’s supposed omniscience, which makes for an excellent bargaining chip when recruiting mortals to his cause; he often works through the concepts of fate and inevitability, convincing mortals that all is predetermined and resistance is futile in order to exploit their nihilism, just as he tempts those obsessed with knowledge and immortality, promising them the secrets of the universe at the cost of their humanity.

##### NilfanÎto
Nicknames - The Architect of Corruption 
Portfolio - Betrayal, Temptation, Expedience, Desire, Impulse, Passion, Deception.
Domain - Impulse
Symbol - Four Pointed Star

Nilfanito is the progenitor of plots and schemes; from conquerors to peasants, all Men are driven by the desire to have that which does not belong to them. Impulsivity is a trait that is known to all creatures, and it is Nilfanito’s will that where there is something to be gained, someone will gain it. He takes pleasure in deception, promising wealth, power, or love, only to strip it away once mortals are trapped in his web. 

His presence manifests in impulsive decisions, sudden betrayals, and deals made in moments of weakness. He operates by seducing mortals with promises of great power or forbidden pleasures, leading them to betray those they care about or make reckless decisions, and his prey are often con men, corrupt merchants, and power-hungry nobles, all looking for shortcuts to success at the expense of others.
##### Ab’galathûn
Nicknames - The Devourer
Portfolio - Disease, Madness, Malaise, Anxiety, Misery, Fatigue
Domain - Pestilence
Symbol - Black Annulet
Ab’galathun spreads their influence throughout all planes, afflicting pestilence and rot upon all living things. The strength of the boundaries between Ab’Galathun’s domain and the material plane waxes and wanes, constantly struggling against their endless hunger for magic; the more they consume, the more the scales tip in the favour of chaos.

# Culture

## Higher Races
The phrase "Higher Race" was coined by Aurelius Gorgax, the first Emperor of Aggrasilla'Kunthropia, to distinguish between what he considered 

This later culminated in an academic publication from the Platinum Archives which gained traction amongst 

Their intentions:
	Make slavery of lower races ok
	Make killing lower races ok
	Make persecution of Higher Races illegal
	Institute rights for Higher Races
	Explain all through science and FAX (EUGENICS)
	Holy mandate, manifest destiny etc
		Korgwynn - demands strength and discipline which only certain races can achieve
		Grognak - demands war and conquest 
		Eldain - the HUNT 
### Miren
##### Physical Traits
Humans exhibit a striking range of appearances and traits which are directly influenced by the extreme diversity of the lands they inhabit. Their physical attributes are known to be the least specialised of the higher races, giving them the flexibility to adapt to new climates and terrains quickly.

Those hailing from Dol’Quoralis have developed hardy physiques and pale, windburned complexions with thicker layers of muscle and fat to insulate them from the freezing temperatures as well as fair hair and sharp, weather-resistant facial features. Drak’Thillians, by contrast, are accustomed to an arid and sun-drenched landscape with a heritage marked by desert survival and nomadic practices; they often have bronze or olive-toned skin and dark hair, with features adapted to withstand intense heat and dry winds. Their slender, agile frames aid them in traversing the sands and rocky escarpments that dominate their homeland.

In the Ancient Isles and many parts of Dol’Calandria where the climate is more temperate, Humans tend to display a balance of traits, from medium to fair complexions and a broad range of physical builds. Those from coastal regions may possess lighter skin and hair due to the maritime climate while Humans from inland regions vary more dramatically in appearance depending on local traditions, resources, and societal structure. 

Men typically live to about sixty to seventy years old and as a result are sometimes considered over-desirous or even impatient by more long-lived races; their short life spans pushing them to achieve success where other races may idle. Humans are sometimes seen as bold to the point of recklessness or overly ambitious, but their undeniable adaptability and zeal are traits to be both admired and feared.
##### Heritage & History
Men are the most predominant race in Valanar, populating over half of the world’s geography and making up for the vast majority of the geopolitical landscape. Magnus is the patron God of Men (although having a hand in the creation of all higher races), he is commonly worshipped across Valanar. Being the most numerous race, they account for a large majority of countries, states, and kingdoms. 

Humans are responsible for the founding of many of Valanar’s oldest kingdoms, with Doyverd serving as the legendary foundation of the Human empires that would later rise and fall. The Doyverd Kingdom is remembered for its sheer scope; the first empire to spread across what is now Dol’Calandria and Draymond. Since the Age of Ascension, Human nations have diversified into a complex patchwork of kingdoms, empires, and city-states, each influenced by the geographic and cultural nuances of their region.
##### Society
Generally, Men get along with one another, though they are of course paradoxically also known to war amongst themselves perhaps more than any other race in Valanar. While Men are known to work harmoniously with the other higher races, they are just as prone to rivalry and conquest with them.  

The societies of Men in Valanar are as diverse as the regions they occupy, with each kingdom and country developing distinct customs, beliefs, and political systems. This diversity also shapes Men’s relationships with other races; in more culturally diverse cosmopolitan hubs like Draymond, where various races and cultures have mingled for centuries, Men are generally tolerant and welcoming toward outsiders, viewing diversity as a strength and source of innovation. However, in more isolated or traditionalist regions, suspicion or even hostility toward other races is more common, with xenophobic attitudes often stemming from local lore or long standing rivalries.

This complex mix of tolerance and insularity reflects the vast geographic spread of Men and the unique pressures each region faces; while they might work alongside Orkryn or Enadriel in one kingdom, they may view the same races with caution or distrust in another, believing them to be rivals or even threats. 
##### Geography
Humans are found in almost every corner of Valanar, their adaptability allowing them to survive and thrive in environments that other races might find inhospitable. From the icy peaks of Einartoft to the verdant forests of Dol’Calenon, Human settlements vary dramatically in climate, architecture, and lifestyle. Each region’s Human population develops its own unique traits and customs, deeply connected to the local geography.

### Dwarrow
##### Physical Traits
The **Dwarrow** are a stocky, broad-built people, standing between 4’5” and 5’2” on average. Their dense bone structure and compact musculature give them a natural resilience, making them significantly heavier than their height suggests. Their bodies are well-adapted to physical labour and combat, capable of enduring harsh conditions for extended periods without fatigue. Their hair is thick and grows quickly, commonly seen in deep browns, reds, and blacks, though silver and platinum hues appear with age. Beards are a defining trait, with both men and women capable of growing them, and many take great pride in elaborate braiding or grooming rituals.

Their skin tones range from earthen hues of deep bronze to ash grey. Dwarrow possess remarkable physical endurance—their compact bodies are well-suited to harsh environments, allowing them to withstand extreme conditions better than other races. 

Their eyes are smaller than a human’s but incredibly sharp, adapted to see clearly in dim light. A secondary reflective layer behind the retina enhances their ability to navigate tunnels and caverns, though bright sunlight can be mildly uncomfortable without protective eyewear. Their ears are slightly rounded and pressed close to the skull, offering some protection against debris and environmental hazards common in underground living.

Dwarrow voices tend to be deep and resonant, carrying well even in noisy or enclosed spaces. Their language is built on hard consonants and guttural tones, making it one of the hardest languages to learn for non-native speakers. 

A Dwarrow’s lifespan far exceeds that of humans, with most living well past 300 years. They age gradually, maintaining their strength and skill for centuries before the effects of time begin to slow them. 
###### Deep Dwarrow
In the Age of Mists, thousands of Dwarrow were forced underground across centuries of societal collapse and natural disasters rendering the surface barren and uninhabitable; this mass exodus eventually resulted in the birth of a new sub-race of Dwarf; the Deep Dwarrow. They possess 
similar eyesight to the Enadriel, who likewise evolved to sense their environments in the dark, though the Deep Dwarrow are typically much more attuned to the presence of natural light. 

Deep Dwarrow skin colour ranges from ebony to charcoal, 
##### Heritage & History
During the Great Exodus, the Dwarrow clans who migrated from Luperron were separated during a great storm which cast them into different parts of the world along with their Orkryn allies, as most ended up in either Dol-Quoralis and the Snow Kingdom to the far south or the lands of Malyria and Nazkuga in the far northern reaches of Dol'Valkhiir. 

Following the Desolation of Malyria, which itself can only be described as a magical catastrophe of apocalyptic scale, 
##### Society
While it’s true that most cultures revere their elderly, the Dwarrow take patronage and ancestral pride very seriously, venerating their oldest and most experienced warriors and scholars and respecting the traditions of family and duty. 

While Dwarrow are known for their fierce tempers, they tend to avoid open violence between one another. Disputes within a community are resolved through the practice of the Grudge Drink, a ritual where feuding parties come together to drink and speak their grievances, with the last man at the table being declared the ultimate winner of the dispute if no consensus is reached; failing that, a more physical solution known as the Pug, is employed—an organised fistfight overseen by elders in which neither of the aggrieved fighters are allowed to rest until either of them are victorious. These practices prevent grudges from festering into something more dangerous while maintaining a sense of honour and brotherhood within the clan.

### Kanin
##### Physical Traits
The Kanin are believed to have been created by Eldain, the Lady of Wolves, a surprising origin given their rabbit-like appearance. Standing between five to seven feet tall, they are tall for their form, with long, powerful legs and large ears that provide keen hearing. Their bodies are covered in short, dense fur that ranges in colour from shades of earthy brown and grey to snowy white, with some regional variations occurring in colder climates where white fur provides natural camouflage.

The most distinctive feature of the Kanin is their large, upright ears. These ears are highly expressive and provide the Kanin with exceptional hearing, allowing them to detect sounds over great distances. This heightened sense of hearing plays a crucial role in their combat and hunting practices, as they are able to sense approaching threats long before they are visible. Their ears also serve as a key aspect of non-verbal communication within Kanin society, often moving in tandem with their facial expressions to convey emotion or intent.

Due to the structure of their faces, the Kanin have a limited spoken vocabulary, though they can produce short, clipped speech. Most communication happens through a sophisticated sign language that includes hand gestures, facial expressions, and even ear movements. Their hands, with one less finger than humans and protrusible claws, are extremely dexterous, allowing them to communicate quickly and effectively with others of their kind.

While the Kanin share a similar lifespan to humans, typically living around seventy to eighty years, they reach maturity much faster. By the age of fourteen or fifteen, a Kanin is considered an adult, having undergone rigorous training in their chosen role within their clan. 

##### Heritage & History
The Kanin are a people shaped by cycles of unification and conflict; their history is largely defined by the rise and fall of Shogunates—a system in which one clan temporarily rises above the others to unite the clans under one banner. However, these periods of unity have always been fragile, and betrayal or assassination often leads to the collapse of these regimes, plunging Nauska back into inter-clan warfare.

The first major unification of the Kanin came with the Sadao Shogunate, led by the legendary Shogun Sadao. Sadao rose to power in a time of external threat, when the Kanin were being invaded by the forces of Old Vitgaard, a powerful foreign empire. With cunning strategy and unmatched martial prowess, Sadao united the warring clans and led them to victory against the invaders, driving them from Kanin lands. His reign is remembered as a time of strength, unity, and honour, though it was short-lived. Following his death, the Sadao Shogunate quickly crumbled as the clans vied to fill the power vacuum, leading to a new era of clan wars.

After centuries of intermittent warfare, the Kanin were once again united under the Hanari Shogunate, which is remembered for its strict enforcement of the Samurai code and the establishment of the Northern Concordat, a treaty that brought relative peace to the region. Under the Hanari, the laws governing the Samurai were codified, and Nauska enjoyed an extended period of stability. However, the Hanari Shogunate too fell victim to internal strife; in one of the most infamous moments in Kanin history, Clan Harimau, long-standing allies of the Hanari, betrayed them, assassinating the entire ruling family in a bloody coup.
##### Society
At the heart of Kanin life is the clan, a family unit extended across generations, with each clan ruling over a specific territory in Nauska. The clan is the ultimate source of identity and protection for its members, and the concept of individualism is largely absent; one’s actions reflect upon the entire clan. Clan loyalty is paramount, and betraying one's clan is one of the greatest shames a Kanin can endure.

Each clan is organised under a strict hierarchy, with clear divisions of roles and responsibilities.The Samurai are the protectors of the clan and enforcers of its laws, and unlike most other societies where warriors might act purely as soldiers, Kanin Samurai also serve as administrators and judges, responsible for the internal order of the clan. 

Beneath the Samurai are the common Kanin, who make up the bulk of society and are responsible for the daily functioning of the clan’s economy: farmers, artisans, and labourers, the common folk are essential to the clan’s survival, providing food, materials, and craftsmanship that keep the clan running. In contrast to the Samurai, who live by the Okaisha, the common Kanin’s role is dictated by pragmatism—their primary concerns are the day-to-day realities of survival, trade, and resource management. Unlike the Samurai, their lives are less burdened by lofty ideals, though they are still expected to respect the clan’s hierarchy and contribute to its success.

Despite the hierarchical nature of their society, the Kanin maintain a strong sense of community and collective duty. The welfare of the clan always comes before individual desires, and in this sense, the Kanin are deeply communal, valuing cooperation and sacrifice for the greater good. Decisions that affect the clan as a whole are rarely made without consultation.
##### Geography
The Kanin homeland of Nauska lies in the North Western reaches of Dol-Calandria, a region defined by its dramatic contrasts of snow-capped mountains, mist-laden forests, and sprawling river valleys that carve through the land in vein-like patterns. The terrain is as fractured as Kanin history, with each clan occupying distinct territories shaped by centuries of warfare, diplomacy, and rituals. Some clans dwell in fortified mountain strongholds, their halls carved into the stone and guarded by ancestral shrines, while others inhabit lowland rice terraces and forest enclaves, where bamboo groves and sacred springs mark the boundaries of their influence.

The climate of Nauska varies widely, from the frigid highlands of the north to the humid southern coasts. This diversity has led to regional adaptations among the Kanin—white-furred mountain dwellers with thicker coats and broader frames, and leaner, darker-furred Kanin in the warmer lowlands. Despite these differences, all Kanin share a reverence for the land, which is seen not merely as territory but as a living extension of the clan’s spirit.

### Glimmerhin

##### Physical Traits
The Glimmerhin are a diminutive race, rarely exceeding three feet in height, with lithe, flexible bodies built for precision rather than strength. Their defining traits are their exceptional intelligence and instinctual curiosity, both of which drive them toward an almost obsessive pursuit of knowledge. Their sharp, angular facial features and quick, darting eyes betray the sheer speed at which their minds operate, making them seem restless or impatient when interacting with other races. Their hair, which is coarse yet light in weight, grows in thick, chaotic tufts and tends to gray early, often before their fourth decade. Despite this, Glimmerhin do not experience significant age-related baldness, maintaining a full head of hair well into old age.

Their most distinguishing feature is their eyes, which are disproportionately large in relation to their skull size. These eyes possess highly developed irises, which can range from shades of steel gray to bright gold, with some rare instances of violet pigmentation. Their speech patterns and body language often appear erratic or hurried due to a natural predisposition for rapid cognitive processing.
##### Heritage & History
The Glimmerhin once occupied much of the Southern parts of Dol'Calandria before being chased out by the many Human clans who came to the land following the collapse of the Doyverd Empire. While this might have happened thousands of years ago, some cultural boundaries still remain, especially between the Glimmerhin and Humans; despite this, the nations of Jarred and Einartoft have been political and military allies for many years.  

##### Society
While many societies function on hierarchy or bloodlines, Glimmerhin respect only results; the brightest minds rise fast, while those who fail to contribute fade into obscurity. Their cities hum with constant activity—labs, workshops, and factories never sleep, and neither do some Glimmerhin, thanks to alchemically enhanced stimulants. 

Despite their dominance in scientific fields, Glimmerhin society harbours a deep skepticism toward magic. 

It is important to note that while the Glimmerhin are indeed famous for their contributions in the fields of science and engineering, they are rarely (if ever) recognised as capable mages and spellcasters and magicians are often ostracised and viewed with suspicion; Glimmerhin society is built on the mastery of mechanical engineering and alchemy, where every mechanism, formula, or invention has a logical progression and can be understood and replicated. Magic, on the other hand, often has results that can be unpredictable or depend on innate talent rather than calculated effort, which goes against their fundamental worldview. As a result, Glimmerhin magicians are rare, often ostracized or viewed with suspicion. The few who do exist are either self-exiled or forced to live on the fringes of their society, their abilities tolerated only when they can be rationalized through alchemical or scientific principles.

A significant aspect of Glimmerhin society is their symbiotic relationship with the Enadriel. The founding and construction of their Undercities were greatly aided by the Enadriel, who, through their conquest of the lesser races in the Worldcaves, played a crucial role in their establishment. Additionally, the Glimmerhin have a complex dynamic with Goblins, their natural adversaries; following prolonged conflicts where the Enadriel inflicted severe hardships on the Goblin tribes, the Goblins faced a stark choice: submission or annihilation. Many chose to serve under the Glimmerhin, now occupying an important, albeit subordinate, role in their society.

Governance among the Glimmerhin is marked by a tradition of diplomacy and representation. Every century, they conduct the Great Referendum, an electoral process to choose their leaders. The House of Lords, a balanced assembly divided between the Enadriel and the Glimmerhin, comprises eighteen seats, nine for each race. In instances where a Lord is unable to complete their term or opts for retirement, they are empowered to appoint a chancellor elect as their successor, ensuring continuity and stability in their leadership.
##### Geography
Their grand Undercities, carved out of vast caverns, are a testament to their ingenuity and a source of national pride. While a few cities dot Jarred's surface, most Glimmerhin reside within mountainous, clockwork cities constructed of brass and frostiron. These remarkable creations reflect the Glimmerhin's adeptness in harmonising intricate mechanics with the natural world.
### Ende’hel 
##### Physical Traits
Tall and lithe with angular facial features. Mature very slowly at a 10th of the rate of Humans. They can naturally attain any eye colour though they appear much brighter under visible light, turning deep browns to magnificent hazel, or yellow eyes into golden, sunstreaked iris. 

##### Heritage & History
The Ende'hel, known for their profound connection to the sacred lands of 'The Fane' in the Lost Lands, originated as a people blessed by Seradriel in the Age of Mist. Initially, their existence was marked by a delicate balance of power, achieved through strategic manipulation of the Orcs and Giants who also inhabited the region. This approach underscored their diplomatic and cunning nature, in contrast to the more aggressive tendencies of the Enadriel, their darker skinned cousins. This balance allowed the Ende'hel to maintain their consecrated grounds and uphold their traditions in relative peace. 

Over time, internal divisions emerged, particularly between Nashandra, who advocated aggressive tactics against the Orcs, and Tairon Silverbark, who preferred a more cautious approach. Nashandra's insistence on military confrontation over diplomacy, despite the risks it posed to their society, led to increasing racial tensions. This discord eventually escalated into a civil war, pitting the Enadriel against the Ende'hel, and culminating in the exile of the Enadriel from the lands.

The unification of their ancient enemies, the Orcs and Giants, forced the Ende'hel to flee their homeland. Led by Lord Tairon, they embarked on a perilous journey across the Krallen Ocean to the Draymond Empire, losing much of their number to the sea. Displaced from their homeland, they faced initial apprehension from the Human population, but eventually found refuge, exchanging their knowledge and cultural heritage for citizenship and a new home. This political alliance and ultimate integration of the Ende’hel into wider society marked the beginning of a significant cultural renaissance in Valanar, influencing various fields of study and leading to advancements in both magic and conventional knowledge. This integration, while preserving some elements of their isolationist heritage, signified a new phase of cultural exchange and intellectual contribution, particularly in the realms of both science and theology.

### Enadriel 
##### Physical Traits
The Enadriel, often referred to as Dark Elves, are typically tall with slender yet well-defined facial features, sharp cheekbones, and angular complexions. Their skin tones range from a deep ebony hue to shades of ashen grey, depending on whether they are native to the dark recesses of the Worldcaves or more accustomed to surface life. 

Their eyesight is significantly poorer than that of other races and as a result their pupils are almost always milky white; a unique trait which often leads others to mistakenly assume they are blind, though in truth while their vision is indeed limited to blurry shapes and muted colours, they compensate by possessing an extraordinarily heightened sense of spatial awareness and a powerful eidetic memory. These adaptations allow them to navigate the complex, dark environments with uncanny precision and to retain intricate details in their memory - traits which have allowed them to thrive as the apex predators of the Worldcaves for thousands of years. 

Living in the labyrinthine depths of the Worldcaves has sharpened the Enadriel’s proprioception—their internal sense of balance, position, and spatial orientation. They have an acute awareness of their physical positioning, adjusting reflexively to any change in terrain or movement; this sensitivity allows them to move with confidence through the darkest, most precarious environments, from treacherous cave systems to narrow cliff ledges. Even with their limited eyesight, Enadriel can "feel" the presence of walls, ledges, or shifting ground through subtle changes in air pressure and vibrations underfoot, a kind of sensory intuition that allows them to navigate as if they could see. This skill is so ingrained that many Enadriel prefer environments others might find disorienting, giving them a natural advantage in places where heightened sensory awareness is key.
##### Heritage & History
###### The Fane
The Enadriel, like their Ende’hel kin, trace their origins to The Fane, the consecrated homeland gifted to the Seren'el by Seradriel during the Age of Mist. Once a unified race, the Seren'el thrived in this sacred land, building societies deeply influenced by their divine creator. However, the seeds of division were sown as differing ideologies and external threats began to fracture their unity, culminating in the Enadriel's exile and transformation into the people they are known as today.

The Serenadriel, one of the two original branches of Seradriel’s first children, were revered among the Seren'el for their longevity, wisdom, and their unparalleled connection to their creator. Alongside their kin, the Serende’hel, they guided and nurtured the younger generations of Elves in The Fane, shaping the early foundations of their society. Their lifespans stretched over millennia, granting them an almost mythic status among their Ende’hel and Enadriel progeny, who viewed their firstborn ancestors as living embodiments of Seradriel’s divine will.

Within this exalted lineage arose Nashandra, a Serenadriel whose influence and ambition would redefine her people’s destiny. Unlike many of her kin who adhered to Seradriel’s teachings of balance and stewardship, Nashandra believed the world demanded strength and decisive action. Her long life afforded her a perspective that transcended generations and she viewed the Serende’hel’s cautious diplomacy as naïve and their reliance on manipulation as a betrayal of Seradriel’s ideals. 
###### Civil War
Her repeated incursions against Orcish settlements sparked outrage among the council, dividing loyalties and ideology. In 410BR, civil war erupted between the Enadriel, consisting of Nashandra’s followers, and the Serende’hel loyalists. Though Nashandra commanded veteran forces and held divine lineage, her campaign ultimately faltered. Defeated in 400BR, she and her followers were exiled from the Fane.

###### Exile To Nydessa
Fleeing south to the Ancient Isles, they landed in Nydessa—only to be met with immediate hostility from the native Orc population. Ravaged and scattered, Nashandra turned to darker powers. She forged pacts with Ilya and Svasna, the Twin Serpents of the Worldcaves, binding her people to new patrons and magical protections. With their guidance, she oversaw the construction of **Tae’eel**, a bastion of Enadriel authority and the heart of their society.

Over the next two centuries, Nashandra reigned with increasing authoritarianism, reshaping the Enadriel into a matriarchal theocracy. Her laws became scripture, her voice prophecy. The worship of the Twin Serpents became central to Enadriel identity, eclipsing even Seradriel’s influence.

##### Society
An Enadriel's upbringing is often marked by a rigorous and disciplined approach, emphasising martial prowess and strategy from a young age. Their education system, involving extensive training and boarding schools, reflects the society's value on preparedness and strength. 

For many centuries, the Enadriel had a complex spiritual relationship with the serpentine beings of the Worldcaves, particularly with the Twin Serpents, Ilya and Svasna. This bond had significant religious and cultural implications for the Enadriel, often leading to internal conflicts due to the enduring influence of Seradriel over their populace; an influence which Queen Nashandra was quick to suppress.
##### Geography
The Enadriel, akin to Dark Elves, have a history deeply intertwined with the Worldcaves, an environment that has profoundly shaped their abilities and culture. 

Historically, the Enadriel were viewed with fear and suspicion, especially before the Duskryn-Steel Accord of 170SR. Their society was often associated with tales of surface raids and kidnappings, contributing to their menacing reputation. The actions and policies of Nashandra, their queen during the Age of Mists, exacerbated this perception, leading to widespread ostracization and fear among other civilizations in Valanar. Even those Enadriel communities that distanced themselves from Nashandra's regime faced the repercussions of these associations.
### Orkryn 
##### Physical Traits
Often very tall and physically imposing creatures with very lean muscles and small tusks protruding from their lower jaw.

While a large majority of the general Orc population descend from The Fane, where the skin tone of most Orkryn ranges from light green to dark yellow, Orkryn who are native Nazkuga and parts of Dol’Quoralis possess a more monochromatic pigment ranging from ebony to pale white. 
##### Heritage & History
The vast majority of the Orcish population can trace their lineage back to the Kingdom of Nazkuga, where it is believed that Orkryn and Dwarrow lived in relative harmony before the Desolation of Malyria. 
##### Society
Genealogically speaking, the Orkryn are considered distant cousins of both Humans and Elves, with much of the same physiological makeup. Temperamentally speaking, however, the two could not be more different, sharing very few instinctual behaviours; save for their mutual love of canines. 
##### Geography
Family and Clan Ties are paramount in Orkryn society. Clans are both spiritual and social units, with members working together to ensure the survival and prosperity of the group. Decisions that affect the clan are often made collectively, and chiefs or war leaders are chosen based on merit but always with input from the shamanic elders. As a result, the Orkryn are often reluctant to leave their homelands. Their deep-rooted connection to their territory—the forests, mountains, or plains they have called home for generations—makes them hesitant to wander or settle far from their ancestral homes.
### Lithfolk
##### Physical Traits
Halflings are a small-statured race, averaging around 3 to 5 feet in height. They possess a stocky but nimble build, with rounded faces and wide, expressive eyes. Their hair is typically curly or wavy, and their skin tones range from fair to olive, depending on their regional origins.

Halflings are generally very sociable and cordial beings known as much for their humour as they are for their short stature. They are believed to experience emotions much more vividly than other races and operate under a fairly stringent social etiquette as a result. 
##### Heritage & History
Halflings are very similar to Glimmerhin in genealogical terms, and it is believed that the two races shared the continent of Dol’Calandria during the Age of Mists before the Primordial Sacrifice took place. 
##### Society
Halfling society is structured around a loose but functional caste system. At the top are the Merchants' Guilds, families or clans that control trade networks, both legal and illicit. Beneath them are the Artisans and Traders, who craft fine goods and move between settlements, often trading unique items, exotic spices, or rare components. At the lowest level are the Laborers and Farmers, who grow the food and provide essential services, but even they are involved in trade.

Leisure is central to Halfling life and they are famed for their inventive games and competitive pastimes; many world renowned ball, board and card games were invented by Halflings as leisure is used not just for entertainment but to sharpen their negotiation skills and wit.

Halfling cuisine is world famous, as even long before Halflings settled in The Westerlands, they were renowned for their artisanal foods which had not yet been seen in other parts of the world - cheeses, oils & vinegars, fruit preserves, cured meats, and perhaps most famously, ale. 
##### Geography
Due to their physicality, Halflings prefer warmer climates. The majority of the Halflings in Valanar live in The Westerlands as part of one of the world’s most homogenous societies. 
### Draconians
##### Physical Traits
The Drakkahn are the hybrid descendants of dragons and humans, their appearance embodying the formidable traits of their draconic ancestors. Towering over most other races, Drakkahn typically stand six to eight feet tall, with broad, powerful builds that emphasize their natural strength. Their bodies are covered in tough, reptilian scales that shimmer in hues tied to their lineage: vibrant reds, blues, and greens for chromatic Drakkahn, and metallic golds, silvers, and bronzes for metallics. These scales, while not as durable as those of true dragons, offer significant natural protection, particularly against the elements.

They possess angular, elongated faces crowned with rows of horns and facial spikes, which vary in size and shape depending on ancestry. Their eyes are strikingly dark with vertical, reptilian pupils and their mouths are filled with sharp teeth and a long, forked tongue to enhance their speech, lending it a sibilant quality that carries the deep pitch of a draconic growl.
##### Heritage & History
It is a commonly believed myth that Baelthetrax is responsible for the creation of the Drakkhan; they are, in fact, the result of generations of crossbreeding between polymorphed Magical Dragons and Humans. The majority of the Drakkahn originate from the Ancient Isles, 
##### Society
For many centuries, Draconic society was defined by its rigid caste structure and a hierarchy that placed Metallic Dragonborn in positions of sovereignty while Chromatic Dragonborn occupied roles of enforced servitude and cultural disenfranchisement; the deliberate outcome of ideological doctrine passed down by early Kunthropian magisters, who interpreted the metallic heritage as a divine ordination of superiority from Baelthetrax. This treatment stemmed from longstanding racial zealotry, institutionalised through rites such as caudal severance: a ritual by which a Chromatic’s tail is amputated at birth, severing both limb and ancestral pride in a single act of subjugation.

Education, governance, and aerial command remained almost exclusively under Metallic purview; the flying cities stood as both literal and symbolic bastions of elite authority, sustained by arcane infrastructure and a constant influx of resources mined or harvested by the Chromatics. While the floating cities have long since fallen, the social residue of that system persisted well into the modern era, affecting marriage rites, military conscription, and religious observance.

It must be noted that while overt hostilities between Metallic and Chromatic Dragonborn had largely waned by the Age of Heroes, the framework of superiority endured in more subtle forms: in dialect bias, judicial appointments, land ownership, and even access to certain strands of arcane tutelage.

##### Geography
The majority of Draconians reside in Agrassilla’Kunthropia, with its impossible architecture built across cliffside temples, geothermal gulches, and levitating cities suspended by ancient arcana. Chromatic settlements cluster around mines and industrial hubs, especially the Drunmülf Gorge and the Slag Pits. Metallic Drakkahn control Greywharf, the Ivory Crag, and of course, the floating cities. 

### Gyr
##### Physical Traits
The Gyr, commonly referred to by subspecies such as Hilgyr (Hill Giants), Nifalgyr (Ice giants), and Stonegyr (Stone Giant) tower over all of the other Higher Races with heights reaching ten feet or more. Their skin ranges from storm-grey to frost-pale, depending on region, and is often thickened into calloused plates that grant them exceptional resilience. Their musculature is dense and their bones enormous, giving them immense strength at the cost of dexterity. Facial structure varies between subspecies, but all Gyr possess deep-set eyes, pronounced brows, and square jaws. 
##### Heritage & History
In some places, Giants have developed close kinships with local races, rooted in a shared reverence for ancient gods or survival in harsh climates. For example, on Tohren Isle both Hilgyr and Humans share an ancestral bond tied to their shared worship and veneration of the Titans; a relationship which is reinforced through mutual respect, cooperation in defence and shared cultural traditions. The Stonegyr of The Fane formed a historic alliance with the Orkryn clans they had once warred with, bound by their common hatred of the Elves, while in Einartoft, the Nifalgyr are largely isolationist; wary of foreign influence and deeply committed to the ancient traditions that have bound their clans together for untold centuries. 
##### Society
While usually territorial to the point of ferocity, Giants are not generally expansionist; their societies are deeply rooted in the preservation of their lands and traditions rather than conquest or empire-building. Giants rarely involve themselves in the politics of other races unless absolutely necessary, though they may act as arbiters or protectors when called upon. Their natural authority and strength grant them a unique role as respected elders or wardens of tradition, particularly in regions where alliances are forged with local communities.

Giant culture places immense value on oral tradition and the passing down of ancestral knowledge. This practice is especially strong among the Elder Giants, who serve as spiritual leaders and storytellers, ensuring that history and wisdom are retained across generations. The complexity of Giant society often depends on the maturity of the elders within each clan; more intelligent and experienced Giants lead and guide the clan with wisdom, whereas younger and less astute Giants tend to focus more on physical pursuits, like hunting, herding, or defending their territory.

Whereas Hill Giants on Tohren Isle embrace cooperative bonds with local Humans, many Frost and Stone Giant clans live in isolated tribal structures with limited external interaction.
##### Geography
The Gyr favour extreme climates; In Einartoft, they make their homes in glacial caves and tundra valleys where few others can survive. On Tohren Isle, the Hilgyr dwell in sweeping plains and river fortresses, often alongside Human settlements. The Stonegyr of The Fane inhabit ancestral cliffholds carved from living rock, decorated with mosaics and petrified totems. Wherever they dwell, their environments are deeply interwoven with spiritual meaning, and every peak, storm, or crevasse holds legend.

## Factions & Organisations
There have been hundreds of groups, guilds, associations, enclaves and factions across Valanar’s history; below are some of the more historically influential or well documented.

---
### The Circle of Mages
Originally founded in 482BR, the Circle first 

### The House of Daggers
Perhaps the world's most infamous organisation of assassins and death-dealers, the House of Daggers have been shrouded in myth and rumour since as far back as the Doyverd Empire, where contemporary accounts even hypothesise that the group began as King Francis the Black's own personal group of loyal killers.  

The method of contracting their services has, like many other facets of the organisation, been a topic of scholarly debate for some time. While some suggest the House of Daggers operate under society’s nose, there are those who posit that their contracts and resources come from the outer planes through bargains made with beings of magnificent influence. 

The latter theory would serve as a possible explanation for the organisation’s seemingly endless amounts of wealth; whenever an assassin believed to be from the organisation has been captured, the reports of a missing ring finger and the possession of opulent weaponry are often found to be common links. Weapons, materials, and armour associated with the House of Daggers are often luxurious and custom-made, with magical enchantments that signify a substantial investment in resources. 

Investigators have tried to trace the supply of these materials, particularly focusing on the origin of the House’s opulent daggers, swords, and armour, as well as the rare potions or magical items found on captured members. Merchants and blacksmiths have been interviewed and audited in attempts to uncover any records of orders for large quantities of rare metals, jewels, or enchanted items, but these investigations have always led to false leads or obscure proxies. Many merchants claim they sold one-off pieces to wealthy patrons, but can never recall who those patrons were, and no names have ever been linked back to the House.

Attempts to trace large sums of money have likewise failed to produce any evidence. Even assassins who have been captured or killed carry no sign of personal wealth—only the weapons and clothing on their bodies. These killers seem to live completely off the grid, with no land, property, or financial assets to their name.  

While several members of the House have been captured, attempts to extract meaningful information from them have proven nearly impossible. Of the seven recorded captures of House members, four committed suicide before they could be interrogated, and the remaining three gave conflicting or nonsensical accounts before being executed. One captured assassin claimed that she did not know her employer, and that her contract had come from a “messenger in shadow”—a being with no face, no voice, and no tangible form. Another insisted that the House was a myth, claiming she had never heard of it even while wearing their distinctive weaponry and bearing the missing ring finger.

The House of Daggers itself is said to be located somewhere within the vast desert of the Dry Sea, but its exact location remains unknown. No maps, guides, or markers lead to the House, and those who attempt to find it rarely return.

### The Watcher Schools
The Watchers are a collective group of warriors across various schools trained from a young age to combat great creatures. Each school was named after the warrior (or warriors) who started them, and in the Age of Ascension, they established themselves as the Watchers; independent schools of warriors bound by a similar ethos. While independent of one another, each school has an elected Grand Master who inherits the responsibility of participating in annual summits and meetings. These summits take place at a different school each year.  As powerful military forces, they act independently of their countries wishes, and have never taken part in wars, except in those which threaten the existence of all life. 

Each school specialises in combating different kinds of creatures, though all schools are trained to handle any general monster threat and are taught using bestiaries which hold centuries worth of information regarding all (or most) of the world’s most dangerous creatures. To a Watcher, knowing the enemy is half the battle, and so, students of each school will spend just as much time in the classroom with ink and quill as they will in the field with their weapons in hand. 

To best combat their school’s focus of creature, each school will teach their students in their respective school’s trademark ‘Arm’, a weapon which the original Masters had used and had passed down to the first of the Watchers who came to learn their ways. They are called ‘Arms’ and not weapons because of their significance to a Watcher; they are their tools of the trade, and should feel as natural to use as their own bodies; an extension of the arm. While many students also learn other methods of combat, with mandatory sword and shield training among them, these school Arms are the symbols of their school, and represent their individual mantras. 
##### The Crow School 
“Stare unto the dark; brace yourself.”
Charge - Maintaining the balance between the worlds of life and death.
Arms & Armaments - Radiant/Sacrificially charged weaponry.

Watchers from the Crow School are warriors without fear. Trained from a young age to battle fiends and the undead, their unique abilities are deeply rooted in the realm of death and blood magic, allowing them to sacrifice their own life essence to gain special abilities. Some members are even rumoured to have the power to communicate with the souls of the departed.

The origins of the Crow Watchers can be traced back to the Age of Mists, when a fighter with a rare affliction rose to renown. Although blind in one eye to the physical world, this individual possessed the ability to see into the ethereal plane and communicate with spirits. Despite being shunned by his village for his unique gift, he went on to become a healer and eventually joined a group of clerics who recognized his talent and trained him to fight. These clerics, believed to have been vigilants of Baelthetrax, became the first Watchers of the Crow.

Watchers of the Crow adhere to a philosophy of balance, believing that mortals should not cheat death once their time has come. The founder of the school rose to fame and prominence in the Kingdom of Doyverd and settled in a keep that he had taken from an Elder Vampire. He passed down his teachings to his pupils, leaving a legacy that has endured through generations.

Although the school's religious ties have been somewhat severed, its roots with The Shepherd (Bannon) remain irrefutable. The Crow School's teachings of sacrificial magic have been developed into sheaths that are inherently linked to the Crow himself. By spilling their own blood into the sheaths, Crow Watchers are able to magically charge and augment their weapons, providing a constant source of power in battle.

##### The Owl School
“Fire with fire.”
Charge - To protect Valanar from nefarious Draconids.
Arms & Armaments - Cross Spear, The Old Blood.

Located in Agrassilla’Kunthropia, the Watchers of the Owl were dedicated to slaying the dragons which plagued the lands for a long period of time, and played a key role in the Ancient Dragon War. Following a ceremony in which a prospective Watcher imbibes the Old Blood of Vala, one of the oldest Iron Dragons, students of the Owl are able to call upon innate magical abilities such as breath weapons and telepathic communication with Dragons. 

The Owl was a chromatic Dragonborn, native to the homeland of all Dragonborn, in Agrassilla’Kunthropia. In a time where more efforts were put into the wars between the chromatics and the metallics, roughly during the beginning of the Unification War, and less into the wars between the evil Dragons who haunted the skies and pillaged undeserving settlements, the Owl took up his spear in defence of his country. He went to settlements of both variations of his kin, and he recruited volunteers from both sides of the fence to join him as he took on the monumental task of challenging his ancestral kin. So driven was he, so fierce was his talent, that Vala, one of the countries oldest and wisest Dragons, who was said to have been around during the days of the first men, blessed the Owl with a part of his power by allowing the Owl to drink from his blood. 

Infused with the power of an ancient Dragon, the Owl went on recruiting more and more volunteers, who learned to put aside the differences in their scales and followed the Owl out into battle. They went into fields and hurled mighty sized spears no other race would be naturally able to hurl, save for a mature full-blood Orc. They went into lairs filled with gold and jewels and slew their slumbering defenders through no small effort; all of which they gave back to the people. 

Upon the finishing of the Unification War, Emperor Aurelius Gorgax (a Kunthropian) named the Owl (an Agrassilan) as a hero of the country, and allowed him to build the school of the Owls, where no matter the tensions between the two factions, larger threats to the country were to be dealt with.  

The school arm of the Owls follows in suit with the Owl and his weapon of choice; the cross-spear. Standing at around six feet in length, the cross spear is a huge bladed polearm, not so dissimilar to a glaive, which is so well balanced it can be used both in the heat of close range battle and thrown as a long range javelin. While this weapon holds no special magical properties, the gift of the Old Blood is passed down to all those who pass its trials, and allow the Dragonborn students of the Owl to tap into their native ancestry, to sense the presence of Dragons, to speak with them in the old tongue, and to tap into their thoughts and senses.
##### The Falcon School
WIP Caldwynn School
- Wolf companions to hunt Griffin nests? 
- Falcon Familiars? 
- Many Half Orcs instruct at the school
- 

##### The Hawk School
“We shall watch, and we shall hunt.”
Charge - Maintain the veil between the planes, hunt those who breach it.
Arms & Armaments - Bladed versatile weaponry with life stealing properties.

The School of the Hawk were Watchers who specialised in dealing with other-planar creatures and entities. The School was founded some time in the Age of Ascension, one of the earliest Schools to be erected, in order to protect the world when the barriers between the abyss and the material plane fell apart. Following the Age of War, a large majority of the School of the Hawk died combating the First Breaches in Khard, and the remainder donned a new name, manning the wall which separates Khard from Draymond. 

The Hawk was a man who was said to have been alive before recorded time. He rose to fame after a priest of Shodahn by the name of Ethel summoned a Balor to the material plane in Brutayne. The Hawk felt a strange stirring as the Balor was summoned, and felt an overwhelming instinctive urge to seek out the strange presence he felt come into the world. Shortly after his summoning, the Balor killed the priest, and was free to wreak havoc on Brutayne.

He continued his travels around the world with the militiamen who had witnessed his prowess and wished to learn, and he continued adding to his small party of disciples as he continued travelling to the places where he felt these stirrings, no matter how far away they were. He was almost bound to them; unable to ignore them until the source of those overwhelming urges was defeated. 

Their School Arm is traditionally an elongated longsword which is either slung to the lumbar or carried in hand, and is taller than a regular longsword by around five inches. These swords are magically able to steal the life force of an abyssal like entity once it breaches flesh.

##### The Vulture School
Charge - The extermination of abominations, hybrids, and necrophages.
Arms & Armaments - Threaded Cane

Not much is known about the Vulture, other than that he was a Human alchemist who settled within the chaotic plane of Khard, where wild and rare plants grow in the most inhospitable of places. He was a talented fighter who attempted to create a cure for the curse of the Balverine and his inquisitions lead to a great deal of research into magical enhancements through alchemical means. 

High ranking members of the Vulture School were ousted and eventually outlawed by the other schools for the experimental mutations its masters tried to force upon their students. Many of the school’s masters were hunted and killed by other Watchers in the years 524-530SR. 

---
### The Illuminators
The Illuminators were originally founded by Master [stand in name] in 262BR as a collective of Valanar’s most enlightened and learned sages, wizards and scholars. Their initial goal was to codify new age academia, while salvaging as much archaic history as possible; their work soon caught the attention of the College of Venizia, and with much cooperation they slowly began their transformation into how they operate today.

Upon the Draconian Empire’s settling in 155SR, a new headquarters for the Illuminators was created in tandem with the construction of the Platinum Archives in Draconia, prior to its ascension to the clouds. 

While it remains true that The Illuminators are a private order of some of the world’s most elite and accomplished academics and researchers, the order is also designed to be inclusive of scholars and students from all walks of life, including those from kingdoms and empires that may be at odds with each other politically. By placing academic merit over national loyalty or political allegiance, the Illuminators foster an environment where intellectual inquiry is protected from the biases of state interests. 

Likewise, members of their organisation are expected to pride themselves on objective scholarship; whether they are exploring the history of war, elven poetry, or the mechanisms of necromantic magic, they approach each subject with a commitment to uncovering truth rather than shaping narratives to benefit one ruler or nation over another. 

Despite this, it is hard to ignore the perceived favouritism toward certain kingdoms; the Platinum Archives in Draconia are known to house the greatest repositories of knowledge in the world, but access to their most sensitive and classified sections is strictly limited to high-ranking members of the Illuminators and select members of the Draconian Empire. While this secrecy is meant to protect dangerous or forbidden knowledge, some believe that the Illuminators favour certain powers by sharing restricted information selectively - in this instance, Draconia, but also the Black Empire. 

Ranking members of the Illuminators can be distinguished by a tattoo seen on their neck and/or back.

- **Student** 
Tuition is not cheap, however there is likely no better education in the world. While the vast majority of students are required to pay for their tutelage, some gain entry by name alone. 
- **Protégé** 
Though rare, Masters can and do pick out promising individuals to act as their understudy. These proteges are often groomed and prepared to occupy high ranks within the order and perform clerical duties as well as menial labour while studying to earn their mark. Proteges are also often selected as assistants in the classroom, giving lectures and mentoring other students. 
- **Counsellor** 
Often recruited from other prestigious institutions within and outside of the Black Empire, counsellors are capable individuals who are hired for their scholastic contributions as well as their primary role as teachers. Proteges will often be promoted to counsellors at a young age, allowing them more time in the field. 
- **Master** 
A Master Illuminator is a title that has been coveted by many and achieved by few. The procedure for becoming a Master includes getting a paper published in the Platinum Archives, no small task. Once their rank has been officiated, Masters are able to take on proteges of their own, as well as being granted permanent tenure.   
- **Grandmaster** 
A rank that can be granted to masters who have left their mark on the academic world in their own right; this rank can be granted posthumously and refers to any individual who excelled in their chosen field of study to the level where their influence forever changed the intellectual landscape. 
- **Master of Illumination**
The rank given to the acting leader of the Illuminators; whoever this mantle falls upon is given the responsibility of handling the daily minutiae of running the organisation, as well as handling political relationships and acting as the figurehead of the committee of Grandmasters which elect them.

## Bestiary

TO DO:

Star Spawn

### Beasts
- **Thundebeast**
A very large and heavy reptilian beast who inhabit the lower crags of the Thanem’s mountain ranges. 

- **Deep Whales**
Growing to almost two hundred feet in length, these enormous leviathans most often reside at the deepest ocean floor they can find; few ever see them in person save for the brief periods of time they surface for air, which is estimated to be once or twice a day. 

They are most commonly seen during their mating season, which is once every six years; during this period, they are known to migrate to the Summer Sea, coming closer to the coastlines than they usually would in search of natural heat sources.  

Their oil is valuable for a multitude of reasons, making them highly sought after by whalers and fishermen. Uses for the oil range from magical to mundane.

Observations by whalers and mariners indicate that these whales are more intelligent than they appear, seeming to hold a high rank in the oceanic hierarchy; schools of fish are often seen swimming amongst them cleaning the plankton from their skin. Their behaviour suggests a deep understanding of the oceanic environment, and they are known to communicate with each other through a complex series of low-frequency songs that can travel for miles through the water. Many commonly believe this to be a primitive form of the Hado due to the psionic echoes detected in the deepwhale’s presence. 

Some cultures such as the Tohren Islanders consider them sacred. 

Valkyn
Standing taller than a horse with a wingspan that stretches over twenty feet, the Valkyn’s body is covered in sleek, dark feathers that shift from deep midnight blue to black, giving it an almost spectral appearance in low light. The creature’s hindquarters resemble those of a powerful panther, with muscular legs ending in sharp, retractable claws. The Valkyn is a solitary predator, fiercely territorial and highly intelligent; it preys primarily on horses and other large livestock, swooping down from the sky to snatch its prey with deadly precision, and its hunting tactics are terrifyingly efficient; often targeting farms and pastures under the cover of night or during storms, using its dark plumage to blend into the night sky. They are known for their eerie, bone-chilling screech when diving toward their prey, which paralyses their target with fear. 

Valkyn are typically found in mountainous regions or dense forests, where they can build their nests in high, inaccessible locations. Their nests are enormous structures, made of large branches and bones from previous kills and usually constructed along cliffsides. Though they prefer isolated regions, Valkyn have been known to migrate to farmlands and open plains during the colder months when food in their natural habitats becomes scarce.

  

Noblin

A small reptile which delights in eating bugs and scavenging carrion. These creatures can be very fast and have very sharp claws, but do not possess an aggressive attitude and much prefer to scavenge rather than hunt for themselves. Noblins are hydrophobic and their scales often collect grease and mould which due to their rotund body they are unable to clean for themselves. Their passive attitudes make them somewhat trainable, though they are often seen as pests by the higher races. 

  

Cat Breeds

Cats have very special magical properties. Domesticated cats have observable levels of empathy, and can sense negative emotion as well as being able to pick up on usually imperceptible changes in psychic energy. Cats are naturally drawn to sources of natural magic and conversely are repelled by negative magic. They are thought to be able to detect ghosts and spirits as a consequence of their abilities.

  

Silkstalker 

Domesticated long-hair breed, 

  

Cave Jaguar

Large cats with sleek black fur who roam the Worldcaves in small packs. Exceptionally nimble with powerful claws, these blind feline beasts hunt along narrow corridors and are notorious ambushers, known to be able to follow scents that are days old, and prefer to stalk their prey from perfect darkness. 

  

Fiends

Fiends are characterised as beings or creatures who have in some way been converted to Fiendhood via a number of different means; mostly through curses and pacts with other-planar entities. 

  

Naoma

Succubus type creature, take the form of vulnerable women and leech on the good will of any who pay them mind. 

  

Karapath

Able to consume any living creature with a single touch; these extremely deadly creatures are spawned from the world caves. The moment a victim comes into physical contact with a Karapath, their cells are immediately assimilated into the creature. They are vulnerable while in sunlight, seemingly unable to maintain their form for long periods while exposed to day. This only means they are easier to detect, however, as they are inhumanly strong with agile, amorphous limbs regardless of its environment. 

Lesser Fiends
Lesser Fiends are mortals from one of the material planes who are believed to have ascended to power by entering into an accord with the Archfiends; this belief is predicated mostly on the assumption that the Archfiends work in similar ways to the Higher Pantheon Gods, being able to deliver messages and assert their will metaphysically through mortals.  

  

Greater Fiends
Greater Fiends, on the other hand, are mindless abominations believed to have been created in the abyss before time began, who possess no psychic energy whatsoever and are simply manifestations of the Primordial Void’s will to destroy and consume the material plane. 

  
  

Undead
An undead creature is classified by its 

Ancient/Primaeval Vampyre
The curse of Vampyrism originates from the blood of Kane, the Morrowsean progenitor of Mankind. 

Vampyre Lord
Vampyre Spawn

Malagaph
A spectral entity who established a deep psychic bond with a certain location. While it is common for the ghosts of warriors to wander the battlefield on which they fell, Malagaphs establish a psychic domain in which they are able to exist after death. 

  

Rainman
A wandering humanoid who wails and cries as rain constantly bombards him. No matter where he walks, the clouds and the torrents follow. Based on the wife's tale of the coming rain being a sign of a bad omen. Depending on the strength of the rainman’s grief, the viscosity of the rain changes to an oily black liquid.

**Vorrakin**
The **Vorrakin**, known colloquially as **"Stone Stalkers,"** are **six-limbed, fleshless entities** whose **translucent skin and hollow bones** make them near weightless, allowing them to **cling to cavern walls and ceilings** as they stalk the unwary. They do not attack with brute strength but instead **wait for their prey to become disoriented in the darkness**, using their **glow-organ lures** to confuse and lure travelers away from safe paths before **striking with needle-like fangs**. Their venom does not kill but instead induces **a paralysis-like trance**, allowing them to **devour their victims over several days**.

#### Meterorite
Meteorite constantly radiates heat and can be embedded in trinkets and jewellery to provide warmth to vital parts of the body. Meteorite is exceptionally rare and is found exclusively in celestial formations which have fallen to the earth. 

The Watcher School of the Eagle notably employ meteorite with incendiary oil to set their weapons ablaze in combat; the meteorite is riveted until the blade's edge fits in-between, where the heat and friction set the oil ablaze instantly.

#### Glice 
A glass-like formation of ice by appearance but with a surface temperature of -20 degrees Celsius. It finds many uses in food preservation and cold storage as well as alchemy.  

#### Atmaglas
A conductive, translucent 
#### Whale Oil
#### Charciron

#### Mindust
This psychoactive mineral-spore compound emerges only under an extremely rare confluence of environmental and temporal factors unique to the shifting dunes of the Dry Sea. Believed to be a trace remnant of Yom Osiris Neba’al’s passage through the sands centuries ago after his friction-carved breathfields left behind pockets of condensed psychic resonance that surface only when the desert slumbers.

The substance itself appears as fine powder, amber-gold when inert, and a deep copper-burnt red when activated through heat or saliva. Upon ingestion, users experience psionic dilation: a temporary expansion of sensory processing and empathic perception. The Psilophytes of the Dry Sea describe this phenomenon as Hado attunement; they claim the spice allows one to listen to ancestral echoes embedded in sand, blood and memory. For just about anyone else, however, its risk is profound, especially outside of its uses in ritual context, and has been linked to countless cases of paralysis, psychogenic seizures and permanent identity loss throughout history. 
##### Harvesting 
Mindust only rises when the sand is utterly still, which typically occurs for only a few hours every lunar cycle, and only along specific migratory dune belts whose movement aligns with deep mineral strata. Even when these conditions are met, mindust doesn’t lie in veins or pods; it seeps upwards through microfractures in the sand crust, appearing as faint copper shimmer across the topmost grain. This top layer must be skimmed with hand-forged obsidian combs, which scatter static charge and allow the Mindust to settle into glass-thread sieves. 

Once collected, it must be sealed within double-walled glass vials or urns lined with desert wax as  exposure to air beyond a few hours causes the psychoactive compounds to lose their potency. Most harvest attempts by the unprepared will fail and on average only a few grams are ever recovered in a successful outing simply as a consequence of both the difficulty in harvesting and the dangers involved; many who attempt the rite unaided suffer fugue states and hallucinations at best or full psychic breakdown at worst as a consequence of overexposure to the substance temporarily lingering in the air. 
# Magic 

## The Essences
The leading methodology for categorising the cosmological makeup of the universe is known as the ‘Theory of Essences’ - consider the existence of three primordial elements; Manamaterium, Metamaterium, and Void. The coalescence of these essences are what governs the world's existence and functionality. Though the Arcane is primarily anchored in Manamaterium, the very fabric of reality is held together by this intricate relationship between the three elements. Magic, therefore, is more than just a harnessing of one; it's the orchestration of all. 
### Manamaterium
In academic circles, the study of manamaterium as a whole is referred to as ‘arcana’; however, both manamaterium and arcana have been known to be used synonymously with the word ‘magic’, which itself can be described not only as the act of harnessing manamaterium to manifest a change in reality, but also as the coalescence of all forms of energy. It is through our understanding of the arcane through the wisdom of the Serende’hel that society has shaped its very foundations. 

There are three primary components to manamaterium; space, radiance, and gravity. As defined by Arch Illuminator Alexander Windfänger; “These three components can be described as the mortar of life itself.” 

- Space refers to the physical dimensions of any given object or creature. It is often the case that practitioners of the arcane, especially those learned in the ways of evocation, are taught how to manipulate space as the first fundamental of spellcasting. Everything in the observable universe takes up and is made of space.

- Radiance is a term which finds its origins in the Age of Mists when radianite was first mined; these precious gemstones emit a brilliant light once their exterior has been cracked, unleashing a burst of magical energy which it houses at its core. It refers to the latent thermal energy of all things; fire and frost are considered primitive examples of radiance at its most dominant amongst the three components. Radiance also refers to the colour and brilliance of all things - to manipulate an object’s radiance is to fundamentally alter how it is perceived. It is possible, for example, to change the colour of flame or to fashion illusions out of thin air with such understanding of radiance.  

- Gravity refers to the density and mass of all observable manamaterium in the material world. It is the silent pull that keeps reality anchored and cohesive. Gravity also refers to unseen forces; sound, vibrations and radiation. 

All objects, animate and inanimate, are made up of manamaterium. Manamaterium (often simply abbreviated as ‘mana’) is considered the material from which all physical things are made - everything that we can see, smell, touch, taste, and hear, is made by and/or is a result of manamaterium. 
### Metamaterium
Existing as an enigmatic blend of Manamaterium and Void, Metamaterium represents both existence and nonexistence in a synchronous dance. Clergymen, psionicists and chronurgists alike all base the foundations of their studies in this field. 

All corporeal creatures capable of congruent thought share a commonality - a soul. While the physical body is tethered to the material plane, the soul exists purely as psionic energy; it is the very structure which grants mortals their conscience, and it does so by acting as a gateway to the metaphysical realm of thought and ego known as the Astral Ocean; a vast metaphysical expanse in which these ideas, these Gods, coalesce and take shape. Here, abstract thought becomes near-tangible, stars become ideologies, and constellations form narratives. 

The components of Metamaterium differ greatly from that of Manamaterium; during the era of enlightenment which followed the Serende’hel Reformation, it was discovered that the soul manifests within the blood of all beings. 

Fundamentally speaking, to cast a spell is to enact your will upon the world in some way. Therefore, magic is only as strong as the innate intellect of its caster; all spells are cast in the mind, with the body becoming a conduit for its output. The body needs to not only be physically capable of enduring this but the caster must be mentally prepared to see the spell through to its completion lest they risk harming themselves. 
### Void
Void stands as the primordial antithesis to Manamaterium, representing a pure absence of elemental essence. It serves as the backdrop of what some might refer to as the ‘Primordial Void’, and is devoid of any further subdivisions. Simply put, Void has no components to speak of - it is itself the absence of materium. It is a devouring force, serving as the components for decay and ultimately for the progression of time itself. 

Void energy is pulled (or channelled) from either the Positive or Negative Poralis, which are the two non-observable black holes located at the very edges of Valanar’s universe. 

Since void is considered as a negative force, it often finds usage in counter-spells, spells which affect gravity, or spells that cause physical or mental decay. Void energy is often extremely powerful when harnessed improperly and can lead to catastrophes such as black holes. 
## The Hado
The Hado is a form of oral psionic manipulation used for commanding and dominating the psyche of one or multiple creatures who hear the voice of the practitioner. For the vast majority of ordinary people, the Hado is almost impossible to withstand without magical defences; spoken commands are followed automatically and interrogations are answered promptly and truthfully. 

The origins of this psychic power are vague. Initial evidence garnered from Orcish scriptures around 130BV suggests the Enadriel were the first race to use this power after settling Tae’eel and establishing themselves as the dominant sentient race of the Worldcaves - no doubt these things are related. Even following the Duskryn Ascension, the Eighth Eye were known for their use of the Hado to recruit and indoctrinate servants into their ranks. 

The Psilophytes of the Dry Sea are similarly known for their mastery

Orcs themselves have also been observed to be partial users of the Hado, as they use vocal magics during various rituals and pre-battle orations to inspire bloodlust or eradicate fear. 

It is possible to build a resistance to the Hado's influence, though extremely difficult; training involves learning how to recognise and disrupt psionic invasions, mostly through repeated exposure and a painful 

## The Eight Schools
Any Wizard worth his salt will categorise themselves as a practitioner of one or more of the eight (8) recognised schools of magic in Valanar, these are: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. These titles are used to quickly identify a given spell’s use or function, but these descriptions barely scratch the surface as to what this magic is able to do; obviously, nothing so powerful and multifaceted could ever be that simple.

Magic, essentially, is the power to enforce your will on the world around you - it can cause great calamities, turn back time, and heal the most grievous of wounds. Throughout time, as with all important things, great effort has been expended in the pursuit to understand more about magic - where it comes from, what the limits are as to what it can do, and most importantly how to harness this power to our will.
### **Abjuration**
Abjuration (derived from ‘abjure’, meaning “to renounce or reject”) concerns magic that creates barriers, and protects against harm. These forms of protection take multiple forms; warding a place against evil, deflecting attacks, and reinforcing the mind against any outside intruders, to name a few. While Abjuration magic is mostly associated with defence, it is not merely a form of protection, and can be used in ways to inflict harm upon any would-be attackers.

Although it is nowhere near as destructive as spells from within the school of evocation, sometimes a good offence is the best defence. Spells can be woven to banish evil spirits, protect against extraplanar incursions, and to defeat practitioners of any other school.

Scholars who study within the school of Abjuration are commonly referred to as ‘Abjurers’, and due to the preemptive nature of their magics, they are widely sought after by commoners and kings alike. They frequently work with churches and store owners, and it is not uncommon to see an abjurer seated in a king’s council. People always value safety, and this school of magic is well known for providing such means.
### **Conjuration**
Conjuration magic (derived from ‘conjure’, meaning “to create”) focuses on creating things out of nothing, and sometimes from other planes of existence. This school can be split into two sections - with one area focused on creation, and the other being purely about moving things and people from one place to another.

‘Creation’ magic is limited to creating inanimate objects like keys, coins, lanterns, etc - but it can also be used in conjunction with things that already exist, like creating the right conditions for a thunderstorm. ‘Movement’ magic can be used to step from one place to another, moving between the fabric of our world; it is not limited to just our world though, and can create gates or portals to other realms. This ‘movement’ magic can lastly be used to pull creatures from other realms, and bind them to your will for a time, which makes it an extremely useful tool, though it is often looked upon with trepidation.

Practitioners of this school of magic are referred to as ‘Conjurers’ - in day to day life it is not uncommon to see them work as store owners, artisans, or as bodyguards. Conjuration is arguably the second most aggressive spell school (beaten only by evocation) due to its ability to summon creatures that the caster can control in combat, and with a healthy amount of utility spells to boot, it is no wonder that so many battle mages choose this school as their focus. 
### **Divination**
Divination (derived from ‘divine’, meaning “to discover”) is a subtle and often misunderstood art, it is more than simply seeing the future, although that is an important part of it. It is responsible for a specific niche of magic where the user is able to find out new things, it is colloquially known as the school of information gathering.

Spells in this school are unmatched when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge beyond mortal limitations, such as the skills of scrying (viewing/hearing things remotely), the discernment of truth, and detecting magic where it would otherwise be invisible. These abilities can be used to mediate conflict, perform diplomacy, and stride further in the journey for knowledge.

Practitioners of this school are known as ‘Diviners’, they are revered by all for their unsurpassed usefulness - from the common people as fortune tellers and sooth-sayers, to merchants and nobility alike for their problem solving skills. Diviners often run businesses selling their abilities, but they are also seen in many facets of life, helping lawmakers discern the truth of crimes, locating specific beasts or people for hunters and bounty hunters - it is true their use knows no bounds. Masters of Divination seem to have command over fate itself, and as such it is common to see them in a King’s court.
### **Enchantment**
Enchantment (derived from ‘enchant’, meaning “to convince”) is devoted to magics that target people’s minds. These magics often affect the thoughts of others by influencing or controlling their behaviour in some way, to their benefit or their detriment; due to this reputation Enchantment is often referred to as the school of control.

Specialists from this school hold immense control over battlefields, and as such they can be a deciding factor in any war. They are excellent at affecting large swathes of people at a time, and a powerful practitioner can even send whole regiments fleeing in terror; the most powerful casters are able to completely dominate a person’s mind, having them do their bidding unquestioningly. These abilities alone can go a long way in sowing chaos within an enemy’s ranks. Enchanters also have access to more niche magics - they can bolster an ally’s spirit to make them work harder, ignore pain, and more. It should be noted, however, that these spells are not effective against those of lesser intelligence, such as beasts, since they lack the necessary mental acuity. 

People who specialise in this school are known as ‘Enchanters’, and due to their reputation for altering people’s minds, they are often greatly feared and shunned by the common people. Due to the nature of their abilities, there are not many day-to-day uses for this school of magic - they are however highly sought after in positions of courts (royal and tribunal) and by military leaders. They are excellent at resolving disputes, gathering information, and getting the truth out of people. It cannot be ignored though that the ability to alter someone's mind is a very dangerous possibility, and even if it is a narrow-minded stereotype, enchanters without due cause should be viewed with caution. You would not know that they have altered your mind until it is too late.
### **Evocation**
Evocation (derived from ‘evoke’, meaning “to cause an effect”) is a school of magic dedicated to manipulating magical energy in order to produce a desired effect; some call up blasts of fire or lightning, while others channel positive energy to heal wounds. Perhaps the most widely studied discipline of magic, Evocation is the creation of pure elemental forces; a rule of thumb is that if it is about manipulating matter and energy, then it is Evocation. This should not be confused with Conjuration, the creation of magical constructs. 

Standout spells from this school are seen as classic battlefield force multipliers: exploding balls of flame, flying bolts of lightning, and vicious earthquakes, to name a few. These are exceptional ways to turn the tide of battle, able to take out multiple targets at once. Single target effects are also in an evoker’s repertoire, with over a dozen ways to remove a high value enemy from the fight as soon as possible. Many tend to forget that healing and restorative magics also fall under the Evocation umbrella - from small grazes and cuts to grievous wounds, Evocation is invaluable in its abilities to save lives and reduce pain.

Evocation specialists are referred to as ‘Evokers’, and as you may have gathered their abilities make them invaluable on the battlefield and in day to day living. Evokers possess the most aggressive magics commonly available, and as such it is not uncommon to see them working as soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards. Conversely, evokers capable of healing are also highly valued members of society, and their skills are in demand both on and off the battlefield; they are essential for keeping communities healthy and productive, as well as for providing support to those in need. Indeed, even the village priest who watches over the sick may be a scholar of Evocation.
### **Illusion**
Illusion (meaning “to deceive”) is the art of deception - creating sensory illusions that trick the mind into seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, or smelling things that are not really there. This school of magic requires much creativity and imagination, as the user must be able to visualise in great detail what they wish to create.

Illusion spells can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating illusions to distract foes in combat, disguising oneself or objects, creating illusions of safety in dangerous situations, or even creating entire imaginary worlds. Those who master the art of Illusion can manipulate reality itself, bending the perceptions of others to their will. 

Students of Illusion magic are referred to as ‘Illusionists’. In extreme cases, illusionists are called upon by spies, assassins, and thieves to aid in their illicit activities, which has led some to view illusionists with suspicion and distrust. Despite this, most use their talents for more honourable pursuits - their abilities are often utilised in the entertainment industry, creating elaborate shows and performances that captivate audiences with visual effects. Illusions are also used for educational purposes, such as simulating scientific experiments or creating visual aids in lectures. In fact, some illusionists are highly respected for their contributions to art, enlightenment, and education.  
### **Necromancy**
Necromancy (derived from ‘necro’, meaning ‘death’) is the sphere of magic which deals with the forces of life and death. In many places it is often considered taboo or even evil due to its association with death, but in reality, it can be used for a variety of purposes. Spells in this school are focused on manipulating life energy, controlling undead creatures, and even bringing the recently deceased back to life. It should be stated that such powerful magic often comes at a price, and still very little is known of the side effects from such dark arts, so it should be studied with the utmost caution.

Despite the negative stigma often shared in contemporary cultures, Necromancy does have a variety of uses for good. Practitioners can use their powers to detect and communicate with spirits, or heal ailments related to death and undeath (such as hexes, curses, and other dark arts); fields such as medicine, or funerary rituals, often require the aid of a necromancer. The most skilled are respected for their ability to navigate the delicate balance between life and death - they may be owed a modicum of consideration, as even through the scrutiny they face they still strive to help those in need.

Practitioners of this school are known as ‘Necromancers’, and as stated above the use of this magic is heavily stigmatised in many societies, sometimes even criminal. This is merely a response from those who fear their power, and to truly understand this magic and make it our own we must study its every facet. The abilities of necromancers are not often utilised in day to day life, they are however occasionally called upon to perform funerary rites or to investigate mysteries surrounding death. Overall, Necromancy remains one of the most controversial and powerful schools of magic, capable of both great good and great evil in equal measure.
### **Transmutation**
Transmutation (derived from 'transmute', meaning "to change in form or nature") is a school of magic that involves altering the properties of objects, creatures, or environments. It is arguably the most versatile of the foremost magical disciplines, capable of transforming base materials into precious substances, giving living beings new shape or abilities, or even altering fundamental laws of nature.

Spells in this sphere range from the simple to the profound. A novice transmuter might learn to turn a lump of coal into stone or alter the colour of an object, while a master could reshape the landscape or turn lead into gold. The practical applications of transmutation are vast, making transmuters invaluable in fields such as alchemy, architecture, and agriculture. They can purify water, increase crop yields, and terraform environments to suit the needs of civilization. Their transformative abilities are essential in industries requiring the manipulation of materials and the enhancement of physical properties.

Practitioners of this school are known as 'Transmuters'. Transmuters must be cautious not to disrupt ecosystems or create imbalances that could lead to unforeseen consequences. The responsible use of their powers is a constant topic of debate among scholars and practitioners. Their versatility and ability to bring about tangible changes make them integral members of society. Whether in the battlefield, the laboratory, or the workshop.
### **Conjunctive Magics**
Conjunctive Magics represent a complex realm where the boundaries of the traditional schools of magic blur and intermingle, giving rise to new and innovative effects. By combining elements from different disciplines, spellcasters can achieve results that would be impossible through the use of a single sphere alone. For instance, blending Evocation with Conjuration might result in summoning creatures imbued with elemental energies, while merging Illusion with Enchantment can create phantasms so convincing that they alter the perceptions and emotions of those who encounter them.

The practice of Conjunctive Magics requires a deep understanding of multiple schools of magic, as well as the skill to harmonise their principles. This balancing act often leads to the development of entirely new magical practices and theorems, expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Conjunctive Magics are particularly valued for their versatility and the strategic advantages they offer, allowing spellcasters to adapt to a wide range of situations with innovative solutions.

Niche spheres of magic have emerged from the study and application of Conjunctive Magics. These include Chronomancy, which blends Transmutation and Divination to manipulate time, and Hemomancy, combining Necromancy and Transmutation to control blood and the life forces within. Another example is Geomancy, an amalgamation of Abjuration and Transmutation, which enables the shaping and manipulation of earth and stone for defensive and offensive purposes. Study into these fledgling arts are often on the fore of arcane advances in Valanar.

While the potential of Conjunctive Magics is vast, it must be stated that their inherent complexities also pose significant challenges. The integration of different magical energies can be unstable, leading to unpredictable results if not handled with care. Practitioners must exercise caution and precision, often engaging in extensive study and experimentation to master these arts. Despite these dangers, the allure of Conjunctive Magics lies in their boundless possibilities, and as such many practitioners young and old ply their craft in this field. Time will only tell if these spheres will flourish into a new age of arcana, or if they are simply the newest infatuation.

## Alchemy & Fauna
**Polkweed**
Appearance: Green, Small (1-2 inches)
Alchemical Use: Medicinal, Pain Relief
Habitat: Westerlands, Mountaintops
A common type of grass which grows in clumps in the misty high altitudes of the Westerlands. When brewed, its alchemical properties are famously akin to willow bark, allowing its use in medicinal herbs and potions.

**Juniper Flower**
Appearance: Blue Petals, Long Stem
Alchemical Use: Poison
Habitat: Brutayne, Plains
Named after the land on which it grows in the Juniper Fields of Brutayne, where a castle had once stood, but has remained in ruins ever since following a violent siege.

**Emperor Haldi**
Appearance: Rose-like, White Petals, Thorned
Alchemical Use: Medicinal / Disinfectant
Habitat: Einartoft, Mountains, Tundra
A gorgeous rose-like flower which blooms only during Borealis. Rubbing it onto an open wound has a chance to act as a natural antibiotic and helps to prevent infections. The flower was named directly after Lord Gentrus Haldi, who led the first pilgrims from Doyverd into Einartoft before the reformation. 

**Spiderflower**
Appearance: Eight Petals, Purple Petals, Short Stem
Alchemical Use: Poison
Habitat: Warm Climate, Woodlands
Named after its eight petals which sprout in pairs of four from either side of the flower, the Dark Elves are known to use this flower for their poisons which are infamously potent, though only they know their recipes for disaster…

**Bloodseed** 
Appearance: Red Petals, Long Stem, Thorned
Alchemical Use: Binding
Habitat: Warm Climate, Mountains, Woodlands, Plains
A striking red flower that blooms during the Spring. Sticky to the touch, bloodseed can be used as an organic binding agent in alchemy.

**Waterpetal**
Appearance: Long Green Stem, Light Green Tip
Alchemical Use: Hydration
Habitat: Swamps, Hot Climates
A droopy green plant which resembles common seaweed, but can be distinguished by its texture, which feels wet to the touch, regardless of climate. When consumed, it fills the lungs up with water until eventually, the one who eats it drowns from the inside. However, when brewed with a mixture of certain scales and taken within hours of mixing, Waterpetal can be consumed and digested naturally, and is quite rejuvenating; as it can keep a person feeling hydrated for up to two days at a time, depending on the quantity consumed.

**Otyugh Cane Nettle**
Appearance: 2-6 Metre Cane, Thorned, Dark Brown
Alchemical Use: Poison
Habitat: Warm Climate, Ponds, Rivers, Swamps
This plant earns its namesake from its appearance, look, and smell. The barbed cane resembles common sugarcane, but stands out by carrying a horrid stench reminiscent of garbage. This plant grows exclusively in areas of low water. To be pricked by the cane nettle would usually cause the area to become numb and/or discoloured, but when distilled from the cane itself the strain could effectively paralyse anyone afflicted.

**Pipe Hogweed**
Appearance: Brown Bush, Short
Alchemical Use: Stress Relief
Habitat: Hot Climate, Dry Places, Drak’Thill
Pipe hogweed is a rare plant that is mostly found in the warmer places of Valanar, but is popular in many places across the world due to its calming psychoactive effects when smoked; due to this, it is commonly referred to as ‘Pipeweed’.

**Inkblot**
Appearance: Thin Stalks, Black Ball on Tip
Alchemical Use: Chemical Diffuser
Habitat: Humid Areas, Underground, Caves
The conditions for this plant to grow are notoriously difficult to emulate precisely, making it a highly sought after and paid for resource; when the juice is extracted from the seed and left to ferment in a warm environment, it separates into the raw material and its base oil. The oil can be used as an antitoxin for many other organic poisons. This small plant grows in clumps not unlike cress, and its oil is even considered an exotic seasoning in some societies of the Underdark.

**Windindle**
Appearance: Small, Orange Petals, Seeds Covering Petals
Alchemical Use: N/A
Habitat: Plains, Woods, Moderate Climate
The windindle is given its name as the seeds covering its petals are blown away in the wind. Children often pick these flowers to blow the seeds themselves. This plant is very commonly seen from Blooming to Departure.

**Sorrel**
Appearance: Small, Thin Stalk, Bulbous Tip, Green
Alchemical Use: Sneezing Powder
Habitat: High Altitudes, Hills
Sorrel is most commonly known for its reaction to physical stimulation - when touched or knocked, the bulbous tip of the plant explodes, shooting seeds and a grainy powder in a short radius. This grainy powder can be collected and used to stimulate sneezing - the plant is thought to create this powder as a deterrent to birds who may try to eat their seeds. Due to this, the plant has earned the nickname ‘Sneezing Sorrel’, as the plant both ‘sneezes’ and makes you sneeze.

**Balsamine Fern**
Appearance: 2-4ft, Wood Stem, Green Pointed Leaves
Alchemical Use: Pain Relief
Habitat: Nydessa, Ironwoods, Kings Woods
When the leaves of the balsamine fern are boiled, and then the water left to evaporate, a starchy white substance is left behind. This substance can be rubbed on a wound to help numb the pain greatly.

**Spotted Knapweed**
Appearance: Green, Flat Oval
Alchemical Use: Solvent
Habitat: Rainforest, Rainy Areas, Swamps
Spotted knapweed acts similar to a fly trap, but instead of the head closing on the fly, instead the face of the plant is covered in a sticky secretion which dissolves the bug whilst sticking it to the trap. This secretion can be stimulated with magic, creating a universal solvent which can burn through inches of wood. This secretion is an essential part to the manufacture of earthrot oil.

**Ironwood Tree**
Appearance: Tall, Dark, Solid
Alchemical Use: Silver Azolla, Purification
Habitat: Nydessa, Nydessan Soil
Ironwood trees are world renown for their unmatched strength, the bark of this tree is comparably as hard as iron, but light as wood. The sap of these trees is also special, named ‘Silver Azolla’, it purifies food of poison when boiled.

**Ambergil**
Appearance: Dark Orange, Small, Translucent
Alchemical Use: Water Breathing Component
Habitat: Underwater, Rivers, Streams, Lakes
Ambergil is found under water that does not go too deep, as it still requires some sunlight to grow. The leaves of the plant are large and layered on top of each other like a soft type of coral. The plant produces a large amount of oxygen, with bubbles even forming. When the leaves are worked alchemically, the paste is used as part of an underwater breathing potion.

**Dragonshroom**
Appearance: Dotted Red Cap, Purple Stem
Alchemical Use: Hallucinogenic
Habitat: Rainforests, Worldcaves, Underground
Dragonshroom is a naturally occurring fungus in the Worldcaves, it appears in areas of stagnant water and dark. It is notoriously hard to reproduce the conditions of its natural growth, but it is possible in some rainforests. When distilled it can be used to create high-class drugs, but it is more commonly consumed raw by Drow slaves in order to keep them sedated.

**Silverfruit**
Appearance: Grey/Silver Berry, Spherical 
Alchemical Use: N/A 
Habitat: Mountains, Pine Trees

**Sweetleaf**
Appearance: A pale yellow leaf which darkens to brown when fully matured. It has a light psychostimulant effect when smoked or orally ingested. Addictive.

# Cosmology

## The Planes 
The most popular methodology for visualising the ordering of The Planes comes from Master Illuminator Dante O'Leary, a cosmologist who famously traversed the corridors of the Chaos Channels.

The ‘material’ plane is encompassed by waters which stretch on as far as the eye can see. In the Age of Ascension, it was possible for powerful navigator wizards to transpose their ships from one side of the plane to the other, though this art eventually became lost to time. 
### Valanar
Otherwise known as the material plane. 

### Morrowsea
While not technically an entirely different plane of existence to Valanar, Morrowsea is considered to be the original home of all living life in Valanar and is by all accounts impossible to 

### Positive Energy Planes

##### The Positive Polaris 
A tear in the fabric of reality, which enables not only the cycle of time but the coalescence of the three primary essences.
##### Luxtraplanum (Light Plane)
Though not impassable 

##### Praesidium (The Plane of Order)
A Kingdom of pristine construction, chalky marble castles on white cliffs are home to agents of Order - Angels. Praesidium also links directly to the Astral Ocean.
##### Limbo
Otherwise known as 'the ethereal plane' by demensionalist. 
### Negative Energy Planes

##### Kaas
Residing on the outermost layer of the negative Polaris, Kaas is believed to be an uninhabitable plane where the beginning and the end of time collide. 
##### Purgatory
As opposed to Limbo, Purgatory is the realm of the dead and the begrudged. Souls burdened with intense guilt or everlasting trauma are damned to remain in the interstice between life and death, suffering the ails of their past life endlessly until they are afforded a chance to right whatever wrongs were dealt to them in their lives. 


## The Astral Ocean

The Astral Ocean has come to be understood as a realm of collective thought and influence. While all of the other planes exist outside or adjacent to the Material Plane, the Astral Ocean is everywhere - it is as real as the air that we breathe, we just can’t see it. Emotion and conscience coalesce and swirl in this unseen vortex, lending every being that ever was and ever will be the thing which makes them more than simply the sum of their parts; intellect.   

Beings of higher consciousness, such as the Gods, are known to have complete access to this realm; while it is unknown whether or not the High Pantheon roamed the planes as mortals, it is well known that they have not only had direct communication with their subjects but have also ordained events and prophecies which have come to be viewed as fallacy or gospel in one way or another. 

Not only this, but according to Serende’hel cosmology, there exist pockets of Manamaterium within the Astral Ocean where the Gods physically reside, inaccessible to any but those with the strongest of psychic connections to their realm. As a result, diviners and clergymen alike have heard and felt their presence through the act of prayer, which is often thought to be the intended method of communing through the Astral Ocean. 

It is within this framework that the Gods manifest, not as sovereign beings of divine might, but as archetypal personifications of ideologies, emotions, and concepts. These deities do not lord over their dominions; they are their dominions. A god of war does not merely rule over battlefields; it embodies the very essence of conflict, strife, and valour.

To worship a God is to be possessed of their ideals and tenets; such strongly held ideals exist within this metaphysical space as tangible psionic energy, growing in influence and reach over time. However, it is not only the pious who have access to the astral ocean; indeed, sometimes, it isn’t even the Gods who are listening, for they too are made of such ideals, and all ideals come from somewhere much more ancient. 

We know not how to traverse the Astral Ocean, if indeed it can even be traversed at all; the elemental chaos channels alone are mostly insurmountable to navigate. Perhaps the Elder Gods intended for it to be a barrier between the material plane and the Primordial Void. Perhaps it is all a coincidence. We simply cannot know.
