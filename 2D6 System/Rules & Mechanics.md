**Actions & Skillchecks**
To resolve an action, the player rolls 2D6 and adds any relevant modifiers, including bonuses from attributes, skills, or situational effects. The total is compared to a Target Number (TN) set by the GM. 

- **Roll 2D6** for any action requiring a test of skill, ability, or chance.
- Add relevant **attribute bonuses**, **skill bonuses**, and other modifiers to the roll.
- Compare the total to a **Target Number (TN)** set by the GM to determine success.

If a Target Number is not explicitly set, players may compare their result against this table to determine its success:

| Roll Total    | Outcome                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **12+**       | Critical Success: Exceptional results. May grant extra benefits.       |
| **10-11**     | Full Success: The action succeeds as intended.                         |
| **7-9**       | Partial Success: The action succeeds, but with complications or costs. |
| **6 or less** | Failure: The action fails, and something bad may happen.               |
**Difficulty**
Sometimes, Target Numbers will be simplified by a difficulty rating; these ratings can be used interchangeably and are useful when assigned to  and locks. 
- **Easy (6):** Routine actions.
- **Moderate (8):** Requires some effort or skill.
- **Hard (10):** Challenging actions.
- **Very Hard (12):** Demands expertise or luck.

**Advantage & Disadvantage**
Certain abilities or effects allow players to roll with advantage, increasing their odds of success significantly. Disadvantage is likewise imposed when making a skill check without the relevant proficiency, attacking with a weapon you are not familiar with, or when rolling for Defence while wearing armour without proficiency. In certain situations, Major Advantage or Major Disadvantage can apply.  
- **Advantage:** Roll **3D6**, take the highest two results.
- **Disadvantage:** Roll **3D6**, take the lowest two results.
- **Major Advantage:** Roll 3D6, take all three dice.
- **Major Disadvantage:** Roll 1D6. 
## **Character Creation**
Decide on your character’s general idea and role. This includes:
- **Class/Role:** What is your character’s primary function?
- **Background:** Who are they, and what’s their story?
- **Goals and Personality:** Why are they adventuring? What motivates them?
#### **Step 0: Race**
Before anything, decide which race you would like to play as. 
##### **Miren (Humans)**
- **Adaptive Heritage**: Once per session, reroll a failed roll.
- **Versatile Training**: Gain one additional skill proficiency of your choice at character creation.

Humans exhibit a striking range of appearances and traits which are directly influenced by the extreme diversity of the lands they inhabit. Their physical attributes are known to be the least specialised of the higher races, giving them the flexibility to adapt to new climates and terrains quickly.

Those hailing from Dol-Quoralis have developed hardy physiques and pale, windburned complexions with thicker layers of muscle and fat to insulate them from the freezing temperatures as well as fair hair and sharp, weather-resistant facial features. Drak’Thillians, by contrast, are accustomed to an arid and sun-drenched landscape with a heritage marked by desert survival and nomadic practices; they often have bronze or olive-toned skin and dark hair, with features adapted to withstand intense heat and dry winds. Their slender, agile frames aid them in traversing the sands and rocky escarpments that dominate their homeland.

In the Ancient Isles and many parts of Dol-Calandria where the climate is more temperate, Humans tend to display a balance of traits, from medium to fair complexions and a broad range of physical builds. Those from coastal regions may possess lighter skin and hair due to the maritime climate while Humans from inland regions vary more dramatically in appearance depending on local traditions, resources, and societal structure. 

Men typically live to about sixty to seventy years old and as a result are sometimes considered over-desirous or even impatient by more long-lived races; their short life spans pushing them to achieve success where other races may idle. Humans are sometimes seen as bold to the point of recklessness or overly ambitious, but their undeniable adaptability and zeal are traits to be both admired and feared.
##### **Dwarrow (Dwarves)**
- **Stonebound Resilience**: Gain +2 Defence while underground or in rocky environments.
- **Master Artisan**: Gain Advantage on crafting rolls (e.g., Blacksmithing, Tinkering).

The Dwarrow are short, stocky humanoids, typically standing between 4 to 5 feet tall, with dense, muscular builds that make them appear broader than most other races. Their skin tones range from earthen hues of deep bronze to ash grey. Dwarrow possess remarkable physical endurance—their compact bodies are well-suited to harsh environments, allowing them to withstand extreme conditions better than other races. 
##### **Ende’hel (High Elves)**
- **Wisdom of the Serende'hel**: Add +1 to Lore or Arcana rolls.
- **Radiant Barrier**: Add +1 Defense against magical attacks.
##### **Mirenadriel (Half Elves)**
- **Keen Senses**: Gain Advantage on Perception rolls in natural environments.
- **Timeless Grace**: Add +1 to Dexterity-based rolls.
##### **Enadriel (Dark Elves)**
- **Martial Prowess**: Once per encounter, teleport up to 10 feet to a shadowed location.
- **Sixth Sense**: Gain Advantage on Perception rolls.

The Enadriel, often referred to as Dark Elves, are typically tall with slender yet well-defined facial features, sharp cheekbones, and angular complexions. Their skin tones range from a deep ebony hue to shades of ashen grey, depending on whether they are native to the dark recesses of the Worldcaves or more accustomed to surface life. 

Their eyesight is significantly poorer than that of other races and as a result their pupils are almost always milky white; a unique trait which often leads others to mistakenly assume they are blind, though in truth while their vision is indeed limited to blurry shapes and muted colours, they compensate by possessing an extraordinarily heightened sense of spatial awareness and a powerful eidetic memory. 

Living in the labyrinthine depths of the Worldcaves has sharpened the Enadriel’s proprioception—their internal sense of balance, position, and spatial orientation. They have an acute awareness of their physical positioning, adjusting reflexively to any change in terrain or movement; this sensitivity allows them to move with confidence through the darkest, most precarious environments. Even with their limited eyesight, Enadriel can "feel" the presence of walls, ledges, or shifting ground through subtle changes in air pressure and vibrations underfoot, a kind of sensory intuition that allows them to navigate as if they could see. 
##### **Orkryn (Orcs)**
- **Brutal Strength**: Add +1 to melee damage rolls.
- **Ancestral Roar**: Once per session, inspire allies within 10 feet to gain +1 on their next roll.

Often very tall and physically imposing creatures with very lean muscles and small tusks protruding from their lower jaw, Orkryn are 

While a large majority of the general Orc population descend from The Fane, where the skin tone of most Orkryn ranges from light green to dark yellow, Orkryn who are native Nazkuga and parts of Dol’Quoralis possess a more monochromatic pigment ranging from ebony to pale white. 
##### **Drakkahn (Draconians)**
- **Draconic Breath**: Once per encounter, deal 1D6 elemental damage in a 15-foot cone (choose fire, ice, lightning, or acid at character creation).
- **Scaled Resilience**: +1 Base TN (9)

The Drakkahn are the hybrid descendants of dragons and humans, their appearance embodying the formidable traits of their draconic ancestors. Towering over most other races, Drakkahn typically stand six to eight feet tall, with broad, powerful builds that emphasize their natural strength. Their bodies are covered in tough, reptilian scales that shimmer in hues tied to their lineage: vibrant reds, blues, and greens for chromatic Drakkahn, and metallic golds, silvers, and bronzes for metallics. These scales, while not as durable as those of true dragons, offer significant natural protection, particularly against the elements.

They possess angular, elongated faces crowned with rows of horns and facial spikes, which vary in size and shape depending on ancestry. Their eyes are strikingly dark with vertical, reptilian pupils and their mouths are filled with sharp teeth and a long, forked tongue to enhance their speech, lending it a sibilant quality that carries the deep pitch of a draconic growl.
##### **Kanin (Rabbitkin)**
- **Long Jumper**: Gain Advantage on Acrobatics rolls. Jump distance is doubled.
- **Superior Senses**: Gain Advantage on Tracking and Perception rolls. 

The Kanin are believed to have been created by Eldain, the Lady of Wolves, a surprising origin given their rabbit-like appearance. Standing between five to seven feet tall, they are tall for their form, with long, powerful legs and large ears that provide keen hearing. Their bodies are covered in short, dense fur that ranges in colour from shades of earthy brown and grey to snowy white, with some regional variations occurring in colder climates where white fur provides natural camouflage.

The most distinctive feature of the Kanin is their large, upright ears. These ears are highly expressive and provide the Kanin with exceptional hearing, allowing them to detect sounds over great distances. This heightened sense of hearing plays a crucial role in their combat and hunting practices, as they are able to sense approaching threats long before they are visible. Their ears also serve as a key aspect of non-verbal communication within Kanin society, often moving in tandem with their facial expressions to convey emotion or intent.

Due to the structure of their faces, the Kanin have a limited spoken vocabulary, though they can produce short, clipped speech. Most communication happens through a sophisticated sign language that includes hand gestures, facial expressions, and even ear movements. Their hands, with one less finger than humans and protractible claws, are extremely dexterous, allowing them to communicate quickly and effectively with others of their kind.

While the Kanin share a similar lifespan to humans, typically living around seventy to eighty years, they reach maturity much faster. By the age of fourteen or fifteen, a Kanin is considered an adult, having undergone rigorous training in their chosen role within their clan.
##### **Glimmerhin (Gnomes)**
- **Luck’s Favor**: Once per session, reroll any failed roll.
- **Lateral Thinker**: Gain Advantage on Engineering or Tinkering rolls. 
##### **Lithfolk (Halflings)**
- **Shrewd Bargains**: 
- **Stubborn Spirit**: Once per , resist being frightened or charmed.

## **Spellcasting**
Spellcasting represents the ability to channel and manipulate Manamaterium. In the 2D6 system, Spellcasting is treated as a proficiency that determines a character’s ability to reliably use magic.  Any character can attempt to cast spells, but non-proficient characters must roll at Disadvantage to determine success. Mages and Clerics automatically gain the proficiency at level 1. Other classes may gain the Spellcasting proficiency through feats, backgrounds, or multiclassing.
- To cast a spell, roll **2D6 + Intellect** Modifier.
- Compare the result to the spell’s Target Number (TN):
    - A roll equal to or higher than the TN means the spell succeeds.
    - A roll lower than the TN results in failure, and the Spell Points are still consumed.
- Non-proficient characters cannot access certain advanced magical options; spells above third level cannot be cast, even when imbibed into a scroll.
- The majority of spells in the 2D6 system are **mental in nature**—spells can be cast **silently** without the need for spoken words or prepared components.
- Spellcasters can use any spell in their **spell repertoire** without needing to prepare them beforehand. The only restriction is **Spell Points** and proficiency.
- **High-Level Spells**: Only spells above **Level 3** require **valuable material components**. These components should be rare and reflect the gravity of altering reality in significant ways.
- **Spell Points**:
    - Each character with spellcasting abilities has a **limited number of Spell Points** that are used to fuel spells. Spell Points are restored after a **long rest**.
- **Scrolls**:
    - Reading magical scrolls requires a **Spellcasting roll** (TN determined by the scroll’s level).
    - Proficient characters can read all scrolls. Non-proficient characters may attempt to use scrolls but risk failure or miscasting.
- **Rituals**:
    - Some spells or effects require time and preparation (e.g., summoning, warding). Proficiency ensures proper execution, while non-proficient characters face penalties or risks; unintended side effects, delays, or even personal harm.
- **Magical Items**:
    - While most magical items can be used by anyone, certain enchanted items may require a **Spellcasting roll** to activate. Proficiency allows reliable use, while non-proficient characters risk wasting charges or activating unintended effects.

## Conditions
Certain spells, traps and effects will impose a condition on your character, usually for a specified time (if not indefinitely); essentially, they are status effects. 
- **Blinded**
	- The character cannot see. Attack rolls against them gain Advantage, and their own attack rolls have Disadvantage. Perception rolls relying on sight automatically fail.
- **Burned**
	- The character takes 1D4 fire damage at the start of their turn. They must spend an action to extinguish the flames or continue taking damage.
 - **Chilled**
	- The character’s movement speed is halved. Dexterity-based rolls and defence rolls take a -1 penalty.
- **Confused**
	- The character acts unpredictably. At the start of their turn, roll 1D6:
		- (1–2): Do nothing and end your turn (if engaged in combat).
		- (3–4): Attack the nearest creature (ally or enemy).
		- (5–6): Act normally.
- **Cursed**
	- The character suffers an ongoing magical affliction. Effects vary but could include:
		- Penalty to a specific attribute (e.g., -1 to Intellect rolls).
		- Increased damage taken from specific sources (e.g., +1D6 damage from fire).
- **Deafened**
	- The character cannot hear. Perception rolls relying on sound automatically fail. Verbal communication is impossible.
- **Dazed**
	- The character struggles to focus. They can only take one action per turn (no bonus actions or reactions).
- **Exhausted**
	- The character suffers escalating penalties:
		- **Level 1**: -1 to all rolls.
		- **Level 2**: Movement speed halved.
		- **Level 3**: Disadvantage on all rolls.
		- **Level 4**: Unable to take actions or move.
		- **Level 5**: Death.
- **Frightened**
	- The character cannot willingly move closer to the source of their fear. Attack rolls and social rolls (e.g., Persuasion) take a -1 penalty while the source is visible.
- **Grappled**
	- The character’s movement speed becomes 0. They must succeed on a Strength roll (TN 10) to escape.
- **Incapacitated**
	- The character cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions. They remain conscious but immobile.
- **Invisible**
	- The character is unseen. Attackers roll with Disadvantage to hit them, and the character gains Advantage on Stealth rolls.
- **Paralyzed**
	- The character cannot move or take actions. Attack rolls against them gain Advantage, and melee attacks are critical hits.
- **Petrified**
	- The character is turned to stone, becoming immobile and unaware. They cannot take actions, and all rolls against them gain Advantage.
- **Poisoned**
	- The character takes -1 to all rolls and 1D4 poison damage at the start of their turn.
- **Prone**
	- The character is on the ground. Melee attacks against them gain Advantage, and ranged attacks against them suffer Disadvantage. Standing requires using their movement.
- **Restrained**
	- The character’s movement speed is 0. Attack rolls against them gain Advantage, and Dexterity-based rolls take a -2 penalty.
- **Silenced**
	- The character cannot speak, cast verbal spells, or use abilities requiring vocalization.
- **Staggered**
	- The character can move or act on their turn, but not both.
- **Stunned**
	- The character skips their turn entirely and cannot take reactions.
- **Weakened**
	- The character’s Strength-based rolls and melee damage are reduced by 1.
- **Berserk**
	- The character must attack the nearest creature (friend or foe). Gains +1 to attack rolls but takes -1 to defence rolls.
- **Charmed**
	- The character regards the charmer as an ally. They cannot attack the charmer and will prioritize their requests.
- **Entranced**
	- The character is mesmerized by a magical or visual effect. They cannot take actions unless attacked or physically shaken.
- **Frozen**
	- The character is encased in ice, reducing their movement to 0. Melee attacks against them gain Advantage.
- **Panicked**
	- The character drops what they’re holding and must spend their movement fleeing from the source of fear.
- **Suffocating**
	- The character cannot breathe and has 3 turns before they collapse. Collapsing at 0 HP triggers the coin-flip death mechanic.
- **Tethered**
	- The character is magically anchored to a creature or location. They cannot move more than 10 feet from the anchor.

## Improvisation Rules
Since the D6 system is designed to remove as many barriers to entry as possible, there are many mechanics and 
- **Improvisation Rules**:
    - Any mundane item can be used creatively for a temporary mechanical effect if the player describes a plausible use.
    - The DM may call for an **Improvisation Check** (using a relevant skill, such as Tinkering, Persuasion, or even a generic "Creativity" roll if desired) to determine the effectiveness of the improvised use.
- **Guidelines for Improvised Actions**:
    - **Improvised Weapon**: For example, a chair, a bedroll, or even a bucket can be thrown as an improvised weapon. A common guideline might be that an improvised weapon deals **1D6 damage** (or modified by its weight/size) and may have additional effects if described well (e.g., knocking an enemy off balance).
    - **Combined Utility**: Items like a piece of rope plus a grappling hook might be combined to secure an area or create a makeshift trap.
    - **Crafting and Puzzle Solving**: Even if an item isn't used in combat, it might be essential for overcoming environmental obstacles (e.g., using a mirror to reflect light onto a specific symbol) or for crafting new gear (e.g., combining leather scraps, thread, and a needle to mend torn clothing).
- **Improvisation Table (Optional)**:  
    The DM might maintain a table for quick reference. For example:
    - Roll a D6 when improvising:
        - 1: The item fails to produce any effect.
        - 2–3: The item produces a minor effect (1D4 bonus or improvised tool for a brief period).
        - 4–5: The item produces a useful effect equivalent to a standard item of its type (e.g., an improvised club dealing 1D6 damage).
        - 6: The improvisation is particularly clever, granting a unique temporary benefit or bonus (DM’s discretion).
