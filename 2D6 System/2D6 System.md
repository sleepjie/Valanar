## Actions & Skillchecks
To resolve an action, the player rolls 2D6 and adds any relevant modifiers, including bonuses from attributes, skills, or situational effects. The total is compared to a Target Number (TN) set by the GM. 

- **Roll 2D6** for any action requiring a test of skill, ability, or chance.
- Add relevant **attribute bonuses**, **skill bonuses**, and other modifiers to the roll.
- Compare the total to a **Target Number (TN)** set by the GM to determine success.

Sometimes, Target Numbers will be simplified by a difficulty rating; these ratings can be used interchangeably and are useful when assigned to traps or locks. 

- **Easy (6):** Routine actions.
- **Moderate (8):** Requires some effort or skill.
- **Hard (10):** Challenging actions.
- **Very Hard (12+):** Demands expertise or luck.

If a Target Number is not explicitly set, players may compare their result against this table to determine its success:

| Roll Total    | Outcome                                                                |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **12+**       | Critical Success: Exceptional results. May grant extra benefits.       |
| **10-11**     | Full Success: The action succeeds as intended.                         |
| **7-9**       | Partial Success: The action succeeds, but with complications or costs. |
| **6 or less** | Failure: The action fails, and something bad may happen.               |
### **Advantage & Disadvantage**
Certain abilities or effects allow players to roll with advantage, increasing their odds of success significantly. Disadvantage is likewise imposed when making a skill check without the relevant proficiency, attacking with a weapon you are not familiar with, or when rolling for Defence while wearing armour without proficiency. In certain situations, Major Advantage or Major Disadvantage can apply:

- **Advantage:** Roll **3D6**, take the highest two results.
- **Disadvantage:** Roll **3D6**, take the lowest two results.
- **Major Advantage:** Roll 3D6, take all three dice.
- **Major Disadvantage:** Roll 1D6. 
### Improvisation Rules
Since the D6 system is designed to remove as many barriers to entry as possible, there are many rules that are 
- **Improvisation Check**:
    - Any mundane item can be used creatively for a temporary mechanical effect if the player describes a plausible use. 
    - The DM may call for an **Improvisation Check** (using a relevant skill, such as Tinkering, Persuasion, or even a generic "Creativity" roll if desired) to determine the effectiveness of the improvised use.
- **Guidelines for Improvised Actions**:
    - **Improvised Weapon**: For example, a chair, a bedroll, or even a bucket can be thrown as an improvised weapon. A common guideline might be that an improvised weapon deals **1D6 damage** (or modified by its weight/size) and may have additional effects if described well (e.g., knocking an enemy off balance).
    - **Combined Utility**: Items like a piece of rope plus a grappling hook might be combined to secure an area or create a makeshift trap.
    - **Crafting and Puzzle Solving**: Even if an item isn't used in combat, it might be essential for overcoming environmental obstacles (e.g., using a mirror to reflect light onto a specific symbol) or for crafting new gear (e.g., combining leather scraps, thread, and a needle to mend torn clothing).
- **Improvisation Table (Optional)**:  
    The DM might maintain a table for quick reference. For example:
    - Roll a D6 when improvising:
        - 1: The item fails to produce any effect.
        - 2–3: The item produces a minor effect (1D4 bonus or improvised tool for a brief period).
        - 4–5: The item produces a useful effect equivalent to a standard item of its type (e.g., an improvised club dealing 1D6 damage).
        - 6: The improvisation is particularly clever, granting a unique temporary benefit or bonus (DM’s discretion).
### **Conditions**
Certain spells, traps and effects will impose a condition on your character, usually for a specified time (if not indefinitely); essentially, they are status effects which affect characters in various ways, influencing rolls, movement, and combat effectiveness. Some conditions can be removed through rest, magic, or specific actions.

| **Condition**            | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blinded**              | The character cannot see, automatically fails Perception checks, and suffers Major Disadvantage on all attack rolls. Attackers have Major Advantage against them unless they possess the Blind Fighter feature.  |
| **Burning**              | The character takes 1D6 fire damage per round until extinguished. If they roll 2 or lower on a D6, they become Panicked.                                                                                         |
| **Chilled**              | Movement speed is halved. Dexterity-based rolls suffer Disadvantage. Lasts until warmth is restored.                                                                                                             |
| **Crippled**             | A limb is disabled. If a leg is crippled, movement is reduced to 5 feet. If an arm is crippled, they have Major Disadvantage on attacks using that arm. Can be treated with medicine or magic.                   |
| **Deafened**             | The character cannot hear, automatically fails sound-based Perception checks, and cannot cast spells requiring verbal components.                                                                                |
| **Disarmed**             | The character drops their weapon or item. Picking it up requires a full action.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Doomed**               | The character suffers Major Disadvantage on all rolls. If they do not receive immediate help, they die at the end of their next turn.                                                                            |
| **Dazed**                | The character can’t take reactions and suffers Disadvantage on all rolls until the end of their next turn.                                                                                                       |
| **Exhausted** _(Stacks)_ | 1st Tier: Disadvantage on physical skill checks.  <br>2nd Tier: Speed halved.  <br>3rd Tier: Major Disadvantage on all rolls.<br>4th Tier: The character falls unconscious.<br>5th Tier: Death.                  |
| **Frightened**           | The character suffers Disadvantage on all rolls while within line of sight of the source of fear. They must move away from it if possible.                                                                       |
| **Frozen**               | The character is immobilized and cannot act. If struck with a bludgeoning attack, they take an additional 1D6 damage.                                                                                            |
| **Grappled**             | The character’s speed becomes 0. They may attempt to break free using a contested Strength or Dexterity roll.                                                                                                    |
| **Hallucinating**        | The character sees false visions, suffers Major Disadvantage on Perception and Investigation rolls, and may mistake allies for enemies.                                                                          |
| **Incapacitated**        | The character cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions but is still aware.                                                                                                                               |
| **Invisible**            | The character cannot be seen. They gain Major Advantage on Stealth rolls and attacks, while attackers suffer Disadvantage against them.                                                                          |
| **Paralyzed**            | The character is completely unable to move or take actions. They automatically fail Strength & Dexterity saving throws and suffer Major Disadvantage on all checks. Attackers have Major Advantage against them. |
| **Petrified**            | The character is turned to stone. They are completely immobilized, unaware of surroundings, and immune to damage except bludgeoning (which deals double damage).                                                 |
| **Poisoned**             | The character suffers Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If the poison is potent, it may also deal 1D6 damage per round.                                                                           |
| **Prone**                | The character must spend movement to stand up. Melee attacks against them gain Advantage, while ranged attacks suffer Disadvantage.                                                                              |
| **Restrained**           | The character’s speed is 0, they suffer Disadvantage on attack rolls, and attackers gain Advantage against them.                                                                                                 |
| **Shaken**               | The character has lost their nerve. They suffer Disadvantage on all rolls until they take an action to compose themselves.                                                                                       |
| **Silenced**             | The character cannot speak or cast spells requiring verbal components.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Slowed**               | Movement speed is halved, and the character may only take one action per turn.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Staggered**            | The character cannot Dash and has Disadvantage on Dexterity-based rolls until they recover.                                                                                                                      |
| **Stunned**              | The character loses their next turn, drops whatever they are holding, and automatically fails Dexterity saving throws.                                                                                           |
| **Unconscious**          | The character cannot take actions, and is unaware of their surroundings. Attackers have Major Advantage, and melee attacks automatically crit.                                                                   |
## **Character Creation**
Decide on your character’s general idea and role. This includes:
- **Class/Role:** What is your character’s primary function?
- **Background:** Who are they, and what’s their story?
- **Goals and Personality:** Why are they adventuring? What motivates them?
#### **Step 0: Race**
Before anything, decide which race you would like to play as. 
##### **Miren (Humans)**
- **Adaptive Heritage**: Once per session, reroll a failed roll.
- **Versatile Training**: Gain one additional skill proficiency of your choice at character creation.

Humans exhibit a striking range of appearances and traits which are directly influenced by the extreme diversity of the lands they inhabit. Their physical attributes are known to be the least specialised of the higher races, giving them the flexibility to adapt to new climates and terrains quickly.

Those hailing from Dol-Quoralis have developed hardy physiques and pale, windburned complexions with thicker layers of muscle and fat to insulate them from the freezing temperatures as well as fair hair and sharp, weather-resistant facial features. Drak’Thillians, by contrast, are accustomed to an arid and sun-drenched landscape with a heritage marked by desert survival and nomadic practices; they often have bronze or olive-toned skin and dark hair, with features adapted to withstand intense heat and dry winds. Their slender, agile frames aid them in traversing the sands and rocky escarpments that dominate their homeland.

In the Ancient Isles and many parts of Dol-Calandria where the climate is more temperate, Humans tend to display a balance of traits, from medium to fair complexions and a broad range of physical builds. Those from coastal regions may possess lighter skin and hair due to the maritime climate while Humans from inland regions vary more dramatically in appearance depending on local traditions, resources, and societal structure. 

Men typically live to about sixty to seventy years old and as a result are sometimes considered over-desirous or even impatient by more long-lived races; their short life spans pushing them to achieve success where other races may idle. Humans are sometimes seen as bold to the point of recklessness or overly ambitious, but their undeniable adaptability and zeal are traits to be both admired and feared.
##### **Dwarrow (Dwarves)**
- **Stonebound Resilience**: Gain +2 TN while underground or in rocky environments.
- **Master Artisan**: Gain Advantage on crafting rolls (e.g., Blacksmithing, Tinkering).

The **Dwarrow** are a stocky, broad-built people, standing between 4’5” and 5’2” on average. Their dense bone structure and compact musculature give them a natural resilience, making them significantly heavier than their height suggests. Their bodies are well-adapted to physical labour and combat, capable of enduring harsh conditions for extended periods without fatigue. Their hair is thick and grows quickly, commonly seen in deep browns, reds, and blacks, though silver and platinum hues appear with age. Beards are a defining trait, with both men and women capable of growing them, and many take great pride in elaborate braiding or grooming rituals.

Their skin tones range from earthen hues of deep bronze to ash grey. Dwarrow possess remarkable physical endurance—their compact bodies are well-suited to harsh environments, allowing them to withstand extreme conditions better than other races. 

Their eyes are smaller than a human’s but incredibly sharp, adapted to see clearly in dim light. A secondary reflective layer behind the retina enhances their ability to navigate tunnels and caverns, though bright sunlight can be mildly uncomfortable without protective eyewear. Their ears are slightly rounded and pressed close to the skull, offering some protection against debris and environmental hazards common in underground living.

Dwarrow voices tend to be deep and resonant, carrying well even in noisy or enclosed spaces. Their language is built on hard consonants and guttural tones, making it one of the hardest languages to learn for non-native speakers. 

A Dwarrow’s lifespan far exceeds that of humans, with most living well past 300 years. They age gradually, maintaining their strength and skill for centuries before the effects of time begin to slow them.
##### **Ende’hel (High Elves)**
- **Wisdom of the Serende'hel**: Add +1 to Lore or Arcana rolls.
- **Radiant Barrier**: Add +1 Defense against magical attacks.

The **Ende'hel** are an ancient and varied people, easily recognizable by their tall, willowy frames and striking features. They are, on average, taller than most humans, with heights typically ranging from 5'10" to 6'8", though their musculature and build remains lean rather than imposing; despite their height, they are proportionally lighter than humans of similar stature due to a lower average body mass and a skeletal system with a higher ratio of cartilage to bone, particularly in the joints, which grants them their distinctive fluidity of movement. Their skin tones range from pale ivory to deeper earthen shades, with some individuals exhibiting a faint iridescence under certain lighting. 

Hair coloration among the Ende'hel follows a broad spectrum, including shades not typically found in human populations. Blacks, silvers, and deep golds are common, though some possess muted blues, violets, or a metallic sheen. Their voices carry a natural resonance, with a smooth and melodic quality that makes even casual speech sound precise and measured. Some say this is due to subtle differences in their vocal cords and throat structure, allowing them greater control over pitch and tone.

Ende'hel age much more slowly than humans, remaining physically fit and mentally sharp for centuries. Though they do eventually show signs of aging, such as a loss of agility and slight weakening of their senses, this occurs far later in life. Some elders develop faint glowing lines on their skin, particularly around their temples and forearms, though whether this is biological or something else entirely remains uncertain.
##### **Mirenadriel (Half Elves)**
- **Keen Senses**: Gain Advantage on Perception rolls in natural environments.
- **Timeless Grace**: Add +1 to Dexterity-based rolls.

The Mirenadriel, or Half-Elves, possess a distinctive physiology that blends the characteristics of their Elven and Human ancestry. Their height typically falls between 5'7 and 6'3, placing them taller than most Humans but shorter than full-blooded Elves. Their builds vary significantly based on lineage, but they often exhibit a lean musculature with an elongated frame, inheriting the Elven tendency for efficient, wiry strength rather than raw bulk.

Their facial structure tends to be sharper and more defined than a Human’s but lacks the extreme angularity of pure blooded Elves. High cheekbones, slightly narrower jaws, and almond-shaped eyes are common features and their ears remain a defining trait; longer than a Human’s but lacking the extreme taper of an Elf’s, resulting in a more subtle but still noticeable point.

Their skin tones vary depending on heritage, though they often exhibit a natural luminosity, particularly in those with stronger Elven ancestry. Some display the near-translucent fairness of northern Elves, while others inherit the ruddier, sun-kissed tones of Humans. Their hair tends to be thick and smooth, with colours spanning from deep ebonies and chestnuts to the silver or platinum hues more common among Elves. 

They exhibit a slower aging process than Humans but lack the near-ageless longevity of full Elves. They mature at a Human-like rate in childhood but experience a slowed aging process after their third or fourth decade, often appearing youthful well into their first century.
##### **Enadriel (Dark Elves)**
- **Martial Prowess**: Once per encounter, teleport up to 10 feet to a shadowed location.
- **Sixth Sense**: Gain Advantage on Perception rolls.

The Enadriel, often referred to as Dark Elves, are typically tall with slender yet well-defined facial features, sharp cheekbones, and angular complexions. Their skin tones range from a deep ebony hue to shades of ashen grey, depending on whether they are native to the dark recesses of the Worldcaves or more accustomed to surface life. 

Their eyesight is significantly poorer than that of other races and as a result their pupils are almost always milky white; a unique trait which often leads others to mistakenly assume they are blind, though in truth while their vision is indeed limited to blurry shapes and muted colours, they compensate by possessing an extraordinarily heightened sense of spatial awareness and a powerful eidetic memory. 

Living in the labyrinthine depths of the Worldcaves has sharpened the Enadriel’s proprioception—their internal sense of balance, position, and spatial orientation. They have an acute awareness of their physical positioning, adjusting reflexively to any change in terrain or movement; this sensitivity allows them to move with confidence through the darkest, most precarious environments. Even with their limited eyesight, Enadriel can "feel" the presence of walls, ledges, or shifting ground through subtle changes in air pressure and vibrations underfoot, a kind of sensory intuition that allows them to navigate as if they could see. 
##### **Orkryn (Orcs)**
- **Brutal Strength**: Add +1 to your STR (Max +6).
- **Natural Defence**: Increase your base TN by 1.

The **Orkryn** are often tall and physically imposing, standing between 6’5” and 7’5” on average. Their musculature is lean but incredibly dense, granting them immense strength without sacrificing agility. Their skeletal structure is reinforced with thicker bones, particularly around the shoulders and forearms, which lends itself well to combat and labor-intensive lifestyles. Small but prominent tusks protrude from their lower jaw, varying in size between individuals and sometimes sharpened or carved for aesthetic or cultural significance. Their bodies metabolize energy efficiently, allowing them to sustain themselves on less food than a human of similar size without significant loss of strength; this trait has contributed to their historical reputation as tireless warriors and laborers, capable of enduring long campaigns or harsh living conditions with minimal resources.

Their facial features tend to be broad and angular, with pronounced brow ridges and high cheekbones. Their eyes are well-adapted to both daylight and low-light conditions, with a reflective layer similar to that of the Dwarrow, allowing for superior night vision. Hair is thick, coarse, and usually dark, though some rare individuals exhibit streaks of silver or red. 

Age affects them differently than most humanoid species. Orkryn remain in peak physical condition well into their first seventy years of life, but when aging does set in, it is often rapid—within a matter of a decade, a once-powerful warrior can be reduced to frailty. Some scholars believe this accelerated decline is due to their high metabolic rates, while Orkryn shamans speak of the "Final Flame," a natural cycle where one’s strength burns brightest before it fades.
##### **Drakkahn (Draconians)**
- **Draconic Breath**: Once per encounter, deal 1D6 elemental damage in a 15-foot cone (choose fire, ice, lightning, or acid at character creation).
- **Scaled Resilience**: +1 Base TN (9)

The Drakkahn are the hybrid descendants of dragons and humans, their appearance embodying the formidable traits of their draconic ancestors. Towering over most other races, Drakkahn typically stand six to eight feet tall, with broad, powerful builds that emphasize their natural strength. Their bodies are covered in tough, reptilian scales that shimmer in hues tied to their lineage: vibrant reds, blues, and greens for chromatic Drakkahn, and metallic golds, silvers, and bronzes for metallics. These scales, while not as durable as those of true dragons, offer significant natural protection, particularly against the elements.

They possess angular, elongated faces crowned with rows of horns and facial spikes, which vary in size and shape depending on ancestry. Their eyes are strikingly dark with vertical, reptilian pupils and their mouths are filled with sharp teeth and a long, forked tongue to enhance their speech, lending it a sibilant quality that carries the deep pitch of a draconic growl.
##### **Kanin (Rabbitkin)**
- **Long Jumper**: Gain Advantage on Acrobatics rolls. Jump distance is doubled.
- **Superior Senses**: Gain Advantage on Tracking and Perception rolls. 

The Kanin are believed to have been created by Eldain, the Lady of Wolves, a surprising origin given their rabbit-like appearance. Standing between five to seven feet tall, they are tall for their form, with long, powerful legs and large ears that provide keen hearing. Their bodies are covered in short, dense fur that ranges in colour from shades of earthy brown and grey to snowy white, with some regional variations occurring in colder climates where white fur provides natural camouflage.

The most distinctive feature of the Kanin is their large, upright ears. These ears are highly expressive and provide the Kanin with exceptional hearing, allowing them to detect sounds over great distances. This heightened sense of hearing plays a crucial role in their combat and hunting practices, as they are able to sense approaching threats long before they are visible. Their ears also serve as a key aspect of non-verbal communication within Kanin society, often moving in tandem with their facial expressions to convey emotion or intent.

Due to the structure of their faces, the Kanin have a limited spoken vocabulary, though they can produce short, clipped speech. Most communication happens through a sophisticated sign language that includes hand gestures, facial expressions, and even ear movements. Their hands, with one less finger than humans and protractible claws, are extremely dexterous, allowing them to communicate quickly and effectively with others of their kind.

While the Kanin share a similar lifespan to humans, typically living around seventy to eighty years, they reach maturity much faster. By the age of fourteen or fifteen, a Kanin is considered an adult, having undergone rigorous training in their chosen role within their clan.
##### **Glimmerhin (Gnomes)**
- **Luck’s Favor**: Once per session, reroll any failed roll (does not stack with Lucky)
- **Lateral Thinker**: Gain Advantage on Engineering or Tinkering rolls. 

The Glimmerhin are a diminutive race, rarely exceeding three feet in height, with lithe, flexible bodies built for precision rather than strength. Their defining traits are their exceptional intelligence and instinctual curiosity, both of which drive them toward an almost obsessive pursuit of knowledge. Their sharp, angular facial features and quick, darting eyes betray the sheer speed at which their minds operate, making them seem restless or impatient when interacting with other races. Their hair, which is coarse yet light in weight, grows in thick, chaotic tufts and tends to gray early, often before their fourth decade. Despite this, Glimmerhin do not experience significant age-related baldness, maintaining a full head of hair well into old age.

Their most distinguishing feature is their eyes, which are disproportionately large in relation to their skull size. These eyes possess highly developed irises, which can range from shades of steel gray to bright gold, with some rare instances of violet pigmentation. Their speech patterns and body language often appear erratic or hurried due to a natural predisposition for rapid cognitive processing.
##### **Lithfolk (Halflings)**
- **Shrewd Bargains**: 
- **Stubborn Spirit**: Once per , resist being frightened or charmed.

Halflings are a small yet robust race, standing between 4’2 and 5 feet with a naturally compact and well-muscled build. Their bone structure is dense but not heavy, with wide torsos and thick limbs that grant them excellent endurance and balance. Unlike Glimmerhin, whose bodies favor dexterity, Halflings are built for efficiency in physical tasks, allowing them to carry significant weight relative to their size without compromising agility. Their musculature develops evenly, making them naturally resilient to fatigue. They tend to be slightly rounder in the face, with prominent cheekbones and wide, expressive eyes that come in rich shades of brown, hazel, and deep green. Their noses are often small but slightly upturned, and their smiles are broad, revealing strong, well-kept teeth.

Hair is a defining trait of Halflings—naturally thick, wavy, or curly, it often grows wild but is meticulously groomed. Dark browns and warm chestnuts are the most common shades, with golden highlights appearing in those who spend much of their lives outdoors. Their skin is warm-toned, ranging from fair to deep olive, often with a healthy, ruddy glow that hints at a life well-fed and well-lived. Halflings also have an advanced sense of taste and smell, and it's this heightened sensory perception plays a significant role in their cultural and social habits, particularly in the appreciation of fine food, drink, and aromatics.

#### **Combat Proficiencies**
Each weapon class deals different amount of damage and require proficiency to use correctly; attempting to wield a weapon without proficiency will incur Disadvantage on all attack rolls. 
- **Light Weapons**: Daggers, shortswords, slings, etc. (1D6 Damage)
- **Medium Weapons**: Longswords, spears, maces. (2D6, Advantage (Take Highest))
- **Heavy Weapons**: Greatswords, warhammers, greataxes. (2D6 Damage)
- **Spellcasting**: See [[#Spellcasting]]
#### **Armour Proficiencies**
**Unarmoured**
**Light**: Fur, Hide, Padded, Leather
**Medium**: Hauberk, Cuirass, Breastplate, Brigandine, 
**Heavy**: Splint Mail, Plate Mail, Scale Mail, 
**Shields**

**Base TN Calculation:**
- **Unarmored TN** = **8 + Dexterity + Strength**
- **Armored TN** = **Base TN (8) + Armor Bonus (from armor worn) + Dexterity (up to cap)**
- **Shields** add a **flat TN bonus** (e.g., +1 for small shields, +2 for large shields).
Attempting to wear armour you are not proficient in reduces your dexterity bonus to zero and 

|**Armor Type**|**TN Bonus**|**Dexterity Cap**|
|---|---|---|
|No Armor|+0|No Cap|
|Light Armor|+1 to +2|No Cap|
|Medium Armor|+3 to +4|Max +2|
|Heavy Armor|+5 to +6|Max +1|

## **Spellcasting**
Spellcasting represents the ability to channel and manipulate Manamaterium. In the 2D6 system, Spellcasting is treated as a proficiency that determines a character’s ability to reliably use magic.  Any character can attempt to cast spells, but non-proficient characters must roll at Disadvantage to determine success. Mages and Clerics automatically gain the proficiency at level 1. Other classes may gain the Spellcasting proficiency through feats, backgrounds, or multiclassing.

At **level 1**, a character with **Spellcasting Proficiency** gains **a pool of Spell Points (SP)** determined by their **Intellect Modifier** and level. **Spell Points = (Intellect × 2) + (Level × 2)**

- A level 1 Mage with Intellect +3 starts with (3 × 2) + (1 × 2) = 8 SP.
- A level 5 Mage with Intellect +4 has (4 × 2) + (5 × 2) = 18 SP.
- A level 10 Mage with Intellect +5 has (5 × 2) + (10 × 2) = 30 SP.

**Casting**:
	- To cast a spell, roll 2D6 + Intellect Modifier. Compare the result to the spell’s Target Number (TN):
		- A roll equal to or higher than the TN means the spell succeeds.
		- A roll lower than the TN results in failure, and the Spell Points are still consumed.
	- The majority of spells in the 2D6 system are mental in nature—spells can be cast silently without the need for spoken words or prepared components.
	- Spellcasters can use any spell in their spell repertoire without needing to prepare them beforehand. The only restriction is Spell Points and proficiency.
	- Only spells above Level 3 require valuable material components.
**Multiclass Spellcasters:**
	- Non-proficient characters cannot access certain advanced magical options; spells above third level cannot be cast, even when imbibed into a scroll.
	- Non-mage classes can gain Spellcasting Proficiency through feats or backgrounds, but they start with 4 SP instead of using the formula.
	- Multiclass characters use the full SP formula, but if they start as a non-mage and later gain Spellcasting Proficiency, they gain SP as if they had started casting at level 1.
**Spell Points**:
     - At level 1, a character with Spellcasting Proficiency gains a pool of Spell Points (SP) based on their Intellect Modifier and Level:
		Spell Points = (Intellect × 2) + (Level × 2)
	Non-mage classes who gain Spellcasting Proficiency through feats or backgrounds start with 4 SP instead of using the full formula.

| **Level** | **Intellect Modifier** | **Spell Points** |
| --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1         | +3                     | 8                |
| 5         | +4                     | 18               |
| 10        | +5                     | 30               |
**Spell Recovery:**
	- Short Rest: Regain Intellect Modifier in SP.
	- Long Rest: Regain all SP.
	- Mana Potions: Restores 1D6 SP when consumed.
**Scrolls**:
    - Reading magical scrolls requires a **Spellcasting roll** (TN determined by the scroll’s level).
    - Proficient characters can read all scrolls. Non-proficient characters may attempt to use scrolls but risk failure or miscasting and must read the scroll aloud.
**Rituals**:
    - Some spells or effects require time and preparation (e.g., summoning, warding). Proficiency ensures proper execution, while non-proficient characters face penalties or risks; unintended side effects, delays, or even personal harm.
    - Ritual casting does not use spell points.
**Magical Items**:
    - While most magical items can be used by anyone, certain enchanted items may require a **Spellcasting roll** to activate. Proficiency allows reliable use, while non-proficient characters risk wasting charges or activating unintended effects.
**Spell Scaling:**
	- **Damage** = Increases damage.
	- **Range** = Doubles the range.
	- **Area** = Doubles the affected area.
	- **Duration** = Extends effect duration.
	- **Knockback** = Increases knockback distance per SP spent.
	- **Cover** = Ignores additional levels of cover per SP spent.
	- **Effect Potency** = Strengthens the spell’s effect (e.g., making enemy saves harder, increasing duration, adding extra effects).

## Combat
### Rules of Engagement
Combat in this system is designed to be fast, fluid, and easy to run, with minimal number crunching. The focus is on narrative-driven encounters where positioning, strategy, and roleplay impact the flow of battle as much as mechanics do. To make an attack, a character rolls:

**2D6 + Attribute Modifier + Weapon Bonus (if applicable)** vs **Target TN**

- If the result meets or exceeds the target’s **TN (Target Number)**, the attack **hits**.
- If the result is lower than the TN, the attack **misses**.
- A natural **12** is a **Critical Success**, granting extra damage.
- A natural **2** is a **Critical Failure**, triggering a fumble or mishap.
#### Turn Structure
Each character acts in **initiative order** and can take the following on their turn:

1. **Primary Action** – The main thing you do on your turn.
2. **Secondary Action** – A smaller action that complements your turn.
3. **Movement** – Move a distance based on your **Dexterity** modifier.
4. **Free Actions** – Minor actions that require no roll.

Additionally, you may **React** to certain events even when it is not your turn.
#### Major Action
A primary/major action is the **main thing** you do during your turn. This includes:
- **Attacking** (Melee, Ranged, Spell, or Miracle)
- **Casting a Spell/Miracle**
- **Using an Item** (Drinking a potion, activating a magic item)
- **Interacting with the Environment** (Pulling a lever, flipping a table)
- **Shoving, Grappling, or Disarming an Opponent**
- **Helping an Ally** (Stabilizing a downed teammate, aiding an action)
- **Dashing** (Doubling your movement speed)
#### Minor Action
Secondary/minor actions are smaller, quick actions that support your main action. These include:
- **Drawing or Switching Weapons**
- **Reloading a Crossbow or Firearm**
- **Dropping an Item**
- **Drinking a Potion** (If you hand one to an ally, it costs your Primary Action)
- **Attempting a Minor Skill Check** (e.g., flicking a coin to distract a guard)
- **Intimidating a Foe** (May require a Persuasion or Intimidation roll)
- **Preparing an Action** (Holding an attack/spell until a condition is met)

Some feats may allow more powerful minor actions.
#### Movement
A character can move **a number of feet per round** based on **Dexterity**:
- **Base Movement:** **25ft**
- **+Dexterity Modifier (Max +3)** = **Max 35ft**
- **Heavy Armor Restriction** – If wearing Heavy Armor, **Max 20ft movement**
- **Dashing:** A character can double their movement for their turn.

If using Mounted Movement, the mount's speed determines movement.
#### Free Actions
Free actions don’t require a roll and can be done at any time on your turn. Examples:
- Speaking a few words.
- Dropping an item.
- Looking around (basic Perception).
- Glancing at a map or reading a short message.
- Gesturing to a teammate.
